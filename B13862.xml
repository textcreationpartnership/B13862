            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince I saw you, I saw my father die: how bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and merrily did hee passe thorow the gates of death, as if they had had no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, but much pleasure! Oh that I could as easily imitate, as not forget him! We know we must tread the same way; How happy, if with the same minde? Our life as it giues way to death, so must make way for it: It will be, tho we will not: it will not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:176944:11"/> be happy, without our will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our preparation. It is the best and longest lesson, to learne how to die; and of surest vse: which alone if we take not out, it were better, not to haue liued. Oh vaine studies of men, how to walke thorow <hi>Rome</hi> streets all day in the shade; how to square circles, how to salue vp the celestiall motions, how to correct miswritten copies, to fetch vp olde words from forgetfulnesse, and a thousand other like points of idle skill; whiles the maine care of life and death is neglected! There is an arte of this, infallible, eternall, both in truth, and vse: for tho the means be diuers, yet the last act is still the same, and the disposition of the soule need not be other: it is all one whether a feuer bring it, or a sword; wherein yet, after long profession
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:176944:11"/> of other sciences I am still (why should I shame to confesse?) a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and shall be (I hope) whilest I am: yet it shal not repent vs, as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent scholars repeat their parts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ech other, to be more perfect; so mutually to recall some of our rules of well dying: The first whereof is a conscionable life: The next, a right apprehension of life, and death: I tread in the beaten path, doe you follow mee. To liue holily is the way to die safely; happily: If death be terrible, yet innocence is bolde, and will neither feare it selfe, nor let vs feare; where contrariwise wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse is cowardly, and can not abide either any glimpse of light, or shew of danger. Hope doth not more draw our eyes forward, than conscience turnes them backward, and forces vs to looke behinde vs;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176944:12"/> affrighting vs euen with our past euils. Besides the paine of death, euery sinne is a new fury to torment the soule, and make it loth to part. How can it chuse, when it sees on the one side, what euill it hath done, on the other, what euill it must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? It was a cleare heart (what els could doe it?) that gaue so bolde a forehead to that holy Bishop, who durst on his death bed professe, I haue so liued, as I neither feare to die, nor shame to liue. What care wee when wee be found, if well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? what care wee how suddenly, when our preparation is perpetuall? what care we how violently, when so many inward friends (such are our good actions) giue vs secret comfort? There is no good Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, but is glad of his Audit; his strait accounts desire nothing more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176944:12"/> than a discharge: only the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vntrustie feares his reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither only doth the want of integritie make vs timorous, but of wisdome, in that our ignorance can not equally value, either the life which wee leaue, or the death wee expect. Wee haue long conuersed with this life, and yet are vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: how should wee then know that death we neuer saw? or that life which followes that death?</p>
                     <p>These cottages haue beene ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and wee haue not thought of their fall: our way hath been deepe, and we haue not looked for our rest. Shew mee euer any man that knew what life was, and was loth to leaue it? I will shew you a prisoner that would dwell in his Gaole, a slaue that likes to be chained to his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley: what is there heere, but darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176944:13"/> of ignorance, discomfort of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, impotency of body, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conscience, distemper of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, complaint of estate, feares and sense of euill, hopes and doubts of good, ambitious rackings, couetous toiles, enuious vnderminings, irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some disappointments, wearie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieties, restlesse desires, and manie worlds of discontentments in this one? What woonder is it that wee would liue? we laugh at their choice that are in loue with the deformed; And what a face is this we dote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? See if sinnes, and cares, and crosses, haue not (like a filthy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew) ouerspread it, and made it loathsome to all iudicious eyes. I maruell then, that any wise men could be other but Stoicks, &amp; could haue any conceit of life, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous; not more for the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176944:13"/> of it, while it lasteth, than for the not lasting: we may loue it, we can not holde it: What a shadow of a smoake, what a dreame of a shadow is this, we affect? Wise <hi>Salomon</hi> sayes there is a time to be borne, and a time to die: you doe not heare him say, a time to liue. What is more flitting than time? yet life is not long enough to be worthie the title of time. Death borders vpon our birth, and our cradle stands in our graue. We lament the losse of our parents: how soone shall our sonnes bewaile ours? Loe, I that write this, and you that reade it; how long are we here? It were well, if the world were as our tent, yea as our Inne; if not to lodge, yet to bait in: but now it is only our thorow-faire, one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion passeth, another commeth; none stayeth. If this earth were a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176944:14"/> paradise, and this which we call our life were sweet as the ioyes aboue, yet how should this ficklenesse of it coole our delight? Grant it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; who can esteeme a vanishing pleasure? How much more now, when the drammes of our hony are lost in pounds of gall; when our contentments are as farre from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie as continuance? Yet the true apprehension of life (tho ioyned with contempt) is not enough to settle vs, if either we be ignorant of death, or ill perswaded: for if life haue not woorth enough to allure vs, yet death hath horror enough to affright vs. He that would die cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, must know death his friend: what is hee but the faithfull officer of our Maker, who euer smiles or frownes with his Master? neither can either shew or nourish enmitie,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176944:14"/> where God fauors: when he comes fiercely, and pulles a man by the throat, and summons him to hell, who can but tremble? The messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is terrible, but the message worse: hence haue risen the miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able despaires, and furious rauing of the ill conscience; that findes no peace within, lesse without. But when hee comes sweetly, not as an executioner, but as a guide to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But his salutation is painfull, if courteous; what then? The Physitian heales vs; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paine; and yet we reward him. It is vnthankfulnesse to complaine, where the answer of profit is exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue. Death paineth: how long?
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:176944:15"/> how much? with what proportion to the sequell of ioy? O death, if thy pangues be grieuous, yet thy rest is sweet. The constant expectation that hath possessed that rest, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready swallowed those pangs, and makes the Christian at once wholly dead to his paine, wholly aliue to his glory. The soule hath not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to care for hir suffering, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds hir crowne; which if she were inioined to fetch thorow the flames of hell, her faith would not sticke at the condition.</p>
                     <p>Thus in briefe, he that liues Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly, shall die boldly; hee that findes his life short and miserable, shall die willingly; he that knowes death, and foresees glory, shall die cheerefully and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirously.</p>

If there were no more arguments, God hath so mightilie confuted them from heauen, by the voice of his iudgement, that all the world hisseth at their conuiction.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:176944:20"/> encouraged, multitude of wiues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, theft tolerated; &amp; the frame of their opinions such, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraies their whole religion to bee but the mungrell issue of an <hi>Arian, Iew, Nestorian,</hi> and <hi>Arabian:</hi> A mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of many seeds, and all accursed; In both which regards, nature her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in whose brest God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his royall Law (tho in part, by her defaced) hath light enough to condemne a <hi>Turke,</hi> as the worst Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Let no man looke for further disproofe. These follies, a wise Christian wil scorne to confute, and scarce vouchsafe to laugh at.</p>
                     <p>The Greekish Church (so the <hi>Russes</hi> terme themselues) put in the next claim: but with no better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: whose infinite Clergy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords not a man that can giue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason or account of their own
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:176944:20"/> doctrine. These are the basest dregs of all Christians, so wee fauourablie terme them; tho they perhaps in more simplicitie than wilfulnesse, will admit none of all the other Christian world to their font, but those, who in a solemne renunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on spit at, and abiure their former God, Religion, Baptisme: yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture wee might more iustlie terme them <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> for that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Saint (if a Saint; if honest) by an vnequall diuision, findes more homage from them than his master. These are as ignorant as Turks, as idolatrous as Heathens, as obstinate as Iewes, and more superstitious than Papists. To speake ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously from that I haue heard and read; if the worst of the Romish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the best of the Moscoui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish be compared, the choice will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:176944:21"/> be hard whether should be lesse ill. I labour the lesse in all these, whose remotenesse and absurditie secure vs from infection, and whose onelie name is their confutation. I descend to that maine riuall of Truth, which creeps into our bosome, and is not lesse neere than subtle, the religion (if not rather the faction) of Papism; whose plea is importunate, and so much more dangerous, as it carries fairer probabilitie. Since then of all Religions the Christian obteineth, let vs see of those that are called Christian, which should command assent and profession. Euery religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beares in hir lineaments the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of hir parent: the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore is spirituall, and looks like God in hir puritie: all false reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are carnall, and carrie the face of Nature, their mother, and of him
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176944:21"/> whose illusion begot them, Satan. In summe, Nature neuer conceiued any which did not fauour her, nor the Spirit any which did not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne her. Let this then be the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian stone of this triall; we need no more. Whether Religion soeuer doth more plausibly content Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is false; whether giues more sincere glory to God, is his Trueth. Lay aside preiudice: Whither I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you tendeth all Popery, but to make Nature either vainly proud, or carelesly wanton? What can more aduance her pride, than to tell her, that she hath in her own hands freedome enough of will (with a little preuention) to prepare hirselfe to her iustification; that shee hath (whereof to reioyce) some-what, which shee hath not receiued; that if God please but to vnfetter her,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176944:22"/> she can walke alone? She is insolent enough of her selfe; this flattery is enough to make her mad of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. After this; That if God will but beare halfe the charges by his cooperation, she may vndertake to merit her owne glory, and braue God in the proofe of his most accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate iudgement; to fulfill the whole royall law; and that from the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie of her owne satisfactions she may be abundantly beneficiall to her neighbors; that naturally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith a man may do some good works; that we may repose confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our merits. Neither is our good only by this flattery extolled, but our ill also diminished: our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils are our sinnes; some of them (they say) are in their nature veniall, and not worthy of death; more, that our originall sinne, is but the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176944:22"/> want of our first iustice; no guilt of our first-fathers offence, no inherent ill disposition, and, that by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismall water is taken away what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath the nature of sinne; that a meere man (let mee not wrong <hi>S. Peters</hi> successor in so terming him) hath power to remit both punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sinne, past and future; that many haue suffered more than their sinnes haue required; that the sufferings of the saints added to Christs passions, make vp the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church, that spirituall Eschequer; whereof their Bishop must keepe the key, and make his friends. In all these the gaine of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (who sees not) is Gods losse? all her brauery is stoll'n from aboue: besides those other direct deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from him; that his Scriptures are not sufficient; that their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176944:23"/> fountaines are corrupted, and the streames run cleerer; that there is a multitude (if a finite number) of Mediatours. Turne your eyes now to vs, and see contrarily how wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base Nature, how wee knead hir in the dust; spoiling hir of hir proud ragges, loading hir with repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and giuing glorie to him that sayes he will not giue it to another: whiles wee teach, that wee neither haue good, nor can do good of our selues; that wee are not sicke or fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, but dead in our sinne; that we can not moue to good, more than we are moued; that our best actions are faulty, our satisfactions debts, our deserts damnation; that all our merit is his mercy that saues vs; that euery of our sinnes is deadly, euery of our natures originally depraued, and corrupted; that no water can
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176944:23"/> intirely wash away the filthinesse of our concupiscence; that none but the blood of him that was God, can cleanse vs; that all our possible suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are below our offences; that Gods written Word is all-sufficient to informe vs, to make vs both wise and perfect; that Christs mediation is more than sufficient to saue vs, his sufferings to redeeme vs, his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to inrich vs. You haue seene how Papistry makes Nature proud; now see how it makes hir lawlesse and wanton: while it teacheth (yet this one, not so vniuersally) that Christ died effectually for all; that in true contrition an expresse pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of new life is not necessary; that wicked men are true members of the Church; that a leaud mis-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antor infidell in the businesse of the Altar partakes of the true body and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176944:24"/> blood of Christ, yea (which a shame to tell) a brute creature; that men may saue the labour of searching, for that it is both easie and safe (with that Catholike Collier) to beleeue with the Church, at a venture: more than so, that deuotion is the seed of ignorance; that there is infallibility annexed to a particular place and person; that the bare act of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments conferres grace without faith; that the meere signe of the Crosse made by a Iew or Infidell, is of force to driue away diuels; that the sacrifice of the Masse in the very worke wrought, auailes to obteine pardon of our sinnes, not in our life only, but when we lie frying in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie; that wee need not pray in faith to be heard, or in vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that almes giuen merit heauen, dispose to iustification, satisfie God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176944:24"/> for sinne; that abstinence from some meats &amp; drinks is meritorious; that Indulgences may be granted to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with all the penance of sinnes afterward to be committed; that these by a liuing man may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the dead; that one man may deliuer anothers soule out of his purging torments: and therefore, that hee who wants not either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or friends, need not feare the smart of his sinnes. O religion sweet to the wealthy, to the needy despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate! Who will now care hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth how sound his deuotions be, how leaud his life, how hainous his sinnes, that knowes these refuges? On the contrary, we curbe Nature, we restraine, wee discourage, wee threaten hir, teaching hir not to rest in implicit faiths, or generall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or externall actions of pietie,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:176944:25"/> or presumptuous dispensations of men: but to striue vnto sincere faith, without which wee haue no part in Christ, in his Church, no benefit by Sacraments, prayers, fastings, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficences: to set the hart on worke in al our deuotions, without which the hand &amp; tongue are but hypocrites: to set the hands on worke in good actions, without which the presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming heart is but an hypocrite: to expect no pardon for sinne before we commit it, and from Christ alone when we haue committed it, and to repent before we expect it: to hope for no chaffering, no ransome of our soules from below, no contrary change of estate after dissolution: that life is the time of mercy, death of retribution. Now let me appeale to your soule, and to the iudgement of all the world, whether of these
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176944:25"/> two religions is framed to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of nature: yea let me but know what action Popery requires of any of hir followers, which a meere Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalist hath not done, can not do? See how I haue chosen to beat them with that rod wherwith they thinke we haue so often smarted: for what cauill hath beene more ordinary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, than this of ease and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yea licence giuen and taken by our religion? together with the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings of their owne strict and rigorous austerenesse? Where are our penall works, our fastings, scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, haire-cloth, weary pilgrimages, blushing confessions, solemn vowes of willing beggery and perpetuall continency? To do them right, we yeeld; in all the hard works of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship they goe beyond vs: but (lest they should insult in the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176944:26"/> not so much as the Priests of Baall went beyond them. I see their whips: shew mee their kniues. Where did euer zealous Romanist lance and carue his flesh in deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Baalites did it, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the wiser, neuer the holier. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore this zeale in works of their owne deuising makes them not better than we, or it makes the Baalites better than they: let them take their choice. Alas, these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are but a colour to auoid greater: No, no, to worke our stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne wills to subiection, to draw this vntoward flesh to a sincere cheerefulnesse in Gods seruice: to reach vnto a sound beleefe in the Lord Iesus, to pray with a true hart, without distraction, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, without mis-conceit: to keep the heart in continuall awe of God:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:176944:26"/> These are the hard tasks of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, worthy of our sweat, worthy of our reioycing: all which that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish religion shifteth off with a carelesse fashionablenesse, as if it had not to do with the soule. Giue vs obedience: let them take sacrifice. Do you yet look for more euidence? looke into particulars, and satisfie your selfe in Gods decision, as <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> aduised of olde. Since the goods of our father are in question, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should wee goe but to his Will and Testament? My soule beare the danger of this bold assertion: If we erre, we erre with Christ and his Apostles. In a word, against all staggering, our Sauiours rule is sure and eternall: <hi>If any man will doe my Fathers will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.</hi>

Perhaps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are lesse dull, and more quiet; more waxen to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of grace, and lesse trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to themselues. I accuse none, but whom I know, and whom I dare, my selfe. Euen easie busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are hard to the weake: let others
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:176944:28"/> boast; I must complaine. To keepe our station is hard, harder to moue forward: One while I scarse restrain my vnruly desires, from euill; ofter, can finde no lust to good. My hart will either be vaine, or sullen: when I am wrought with much sweat to detest sinne, and distaste the world; yet who shall raise vp this drosse of mine to a spirituall ioy? Sometimes I purpose well; and if those thoghts (not mine) begin to lift mee vp from my earth; loe, hee that rules in the aire, stoopes vpon me with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tentations, or the world puls me downe with a sweet violence; so as I know not whether I bee forced, or perswaded to yeeld. I finde much weaknesse in my selfe, but more tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. How willing am I to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued! How loth to bee altered! Good duties seeme harsh, and can
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176944:28"/> hardly escape the repulse, or delay of excuses; and not without much strife grow to any relish of pleasure, and when they are at best, cannot auoid the mixture of many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: which do at once disquiet, and discourage the minde, not suffering it to rest in what it would haue done, and could not. And if after many sighs, and teares, I haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to doe well, and resolue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet this good estate is far from constant, and easily inclining to change. And whiles I striue, in spight of my naturall ficklenesse, to hold my own with some progresse, and gaine; what difficulty doe I finde, what opposition? O GOD, what aduersaries hast thou proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for vs weak men! what incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! Malicious and subtle spirits, an alluring world, a serpentine and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:176944:29"/> stubborne nature: Force and fraud doe their worst to vs; sometimes because they are spirituall enemies, I see them not, and complaine to feele them too late: Other-whiles my spirituall eies see them with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and I (like a cowardly Israelite) am ready to flee, &amp; plead their measure, for my feare: Who is able to stand before the sons of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nak?</hi> Some other times I stand still, and (as I can) weakly resist; but am foyled with indignation, &amp; shame: Then againe I rise vp, not without bashfulnesse and scorne: and with more hearty resistance preuaile, and triumph: when ere long surprised with a sudden &amp; vnwarned assault, I am carried away captiue, whither I would not: and mourning for my discomfiture, study for a feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: My quarrell is good, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:176944:29"/> my strength maintaines it not: It is now long ere I can recouer this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, and finde my selfe whole of these wounds. Beside suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, crosses fall heauy, and worke no small distemper in a minde faint and vnsetled, whose law is such, that the more I grow the more I beare; and not seldome, when God giues me respite, I afflict my selfe: either my feare faineth euils, or my vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie passions raise tumults within me, which breed much trouble, whether in satisfying or supressing: not to speake, that sinne is attended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides vnquietnesse, with terror.</p>
                     <p>Now you say, Alas Christianitie is hard: Igrant it; but gainfull and happy. I contemne the difficultie, when I respect the aduantage. The greatest labours that haue answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able requitals, are lesse than the least
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176944:30"/> that haue no regard. Beleeue mee, when I looke to the reward, I would not haue the worke easier. It is a good Master whom we serue, who not only payes, but giues; not after the proportion of our earnings, but of his owne mercy. If euery paine that we suffer were a death, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crosse an hell, wee haue amends enough. It were iniurious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the measure, when we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the recompense. Away with these weake dislikes: tho <hi>I</hi> should buy it dearer. <hi>I</hi> would be a Christian. Any thing may make me out of loue with my selfe, nothing with my profession: <hi>I</hi> were vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this fauour, if <hi>I</hi> could repent to haue endured: herein alone <hi>I</hi> am safe, herein <hi>I</hi> am blessed. <hi>I</hi> may be all other things, and yet with that dying Emperour complaine, with

No euill can arrest mee while <hi>I</hi> am vnder the protection of him, which ouer-rules all good and euill: yea, so soone as it touches me, it turnes good; and being sent and suborned by my spirituall aduersaries to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray me, now in an happy change it fights for mee, and is driuen rather to rebell, than wrong mee. It is a bolde and strange word: No price could buy of mee the gaine of my sinnes: That, which while I repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I would haue expiated with blood; now after my repentance I forgoe not for a world; the fruit of hauing sinned, (if not rather, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing repented.) Besides my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, how large is my possession?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:176944:31"/> All good things are mine, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, to inoy. I can not looke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my owne, nor besides it; and the things that I can not see, I dare claime no lesse. The heauen that roles so gloriously aboue my head is mine, by this right: yea those ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall spirits, the better part of that high creation, watch me in my bed, guard me in my wayes, shelter me in my dangers, comfort me in my troubles, and are ready to receiue that soule which they haue kept.</p>
                     <p>What speake I of creatures? The God of spirits is mine, &amp; by a sweet and secret vnion I am become an heire of his glory, yea (as it were) a limme of himselfe. O blessednesse! worthie of difficultie, worthie of paine: What thou wilt, Lord, so I may be thine, what thou wilt. When I haue done all, when I haue suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

See now how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily you haue chosen; how well you haue sped: Loe there <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, a witnesse aboue exception, vnder his owne hand acknowledgeth to the world, and reckons vp two hundred thirty and seuen contrarieties of doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romish</hi> Diuines.

O the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect accordance of <hi>Peters</hi> See! wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be recorded for a badge of Truth. Let now all our aduersaries scrape together so many contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of opinions amongst vs, as they confesse amongst themselues, and be you theirs. No, they are not more peaceable, but more subtle; they haue not lesse dissension, but more smothered. They fight close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within doores, without noise; all our frayes are in the field: would God we had as much of their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as they want of our peace; and no more of their policie, than they want of our Truth. Our strife is in ceremonies, theirs in substance; ours in one or two points, theirs in all. Take it boldly from him that dares auouch it, There is not one point in all Diuinitie (except those
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:176944:35"/> wherein wee accord with them) wherein they all speake the same. If our Church displease you for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, theirs much more; vnlesse you will be either wilfully incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or wilfully partiall: vnlesse you dislike a mischiefe the lesse for the secrecy. What will you do then? Will you be a Church alone? Alas, how full are you of contradictions to your selfe! how full of contrarie purposes! How oft doe you chide with your selfe! how oft doe you fight with your selfe! I appeale to that bosome which is priuy to those secret combats: beleeue me not, if euer you finde perfect vnitie any where but aboue; either go thither, and seeke it amongst those that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, or be content with what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state you finde in this warfaring nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Truth is in differences, as gold
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:176944:36"/> in drosse, wheat in chaffe; will you cast away the best mettall, the best graine, because it is mingled with this off all? Wil you rather be poore and hungry, than bestow labor on the fanne, or the furnace? Is there nothing worth your respect, but peace? I haue heard that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing of some discords graces the best Musicke; and <hi>I</hi> know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the very euill spirits agree not with themselues. If the bodie bee sound, what tho the coat be torne? or if the garment be whole, what if the lace be vnript? Take you peace; let me haue Truth; if I can not haue both. To conclude, Embrace, those trueths that wee all holde, and it greatly matters not what you holde in those wherein wee differ; and if you loue your safetie, seeke rather grounds whereon to rest, than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:176944:36"/> for your vnrest. If euer you looke to gaine by the truth, you must both chuse it, and cleaue to it: Meere resolution is not enough; except you will rather lose your selfe, than it.</p>

Go to then, whiles others are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:176944:38"/> about worldly dignities, and earthly pleasures, let vs two sweetly consult of the estate of our future happinesse; yet without presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without curiositie. Amongst this infinite choice of thoughts, it hath pleased you to limit our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to two heads. You aske first, if the ioyes of the glorified Saints shall differ in degrees. I feare not to affirme it. There is one life of all, one felicitie; but diuers measures. Our heauen beginnes heere, and heere varies in degree. One Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an an inioyes God aboue another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his grace, as his faith is more: and heauen is still like it selfe, not other aboue from that beneath. As our grace beginnes our glory, so it proportions it: Blessednes stands in the perfect operation of the best faculties, about the perfectest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176944:38"/> that is, in the vision, in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of God. All his Saints see him, but some more cleerely; as the same Sunne is seene of all eyes, not with equall strength. Such as the eye of our faith was to see him that is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, such is the eye of our present apprehension to see as we are seene. Who sees not, that our rewards are according to our works? Not for them, as on merit: Woe be to that soule which hath but what it earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: but after them, as their rule of proportion: and these, how sensibly vnequall? One giues but a cuppe of colde water to a Disciple, another giues his blood for the Master. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent works haue different wages, not of desert, but of mercie. Fiue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents well imployed, carry away more recompence than two; yet both approued, both rewarded
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:176944:39"/> with their Masters ioy. Who can sticke at this, that knowes those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly spirits (to whom we shall be like) are marshalled by their Maker into seuerall ranks? he that was rapt into their element, and saw their blessed orders, as from his owne knowledge, hath stiled them, <hi>Thrones, Principalities, Powers, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> If in one part of this Celestiall familie, the great Housholder hath thus ordered it, why not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? yea euen in this hee hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced; <hi>You shall sit on twelue Thrones, and iudge the twelue Tribes of Israel.</hi> If he meane not some preheminence to his Apostles, how doth he answer, how doth hee satisfie them? Yet more, <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> is more honored than <hi>Lazarus.</hi> I shall need no more proofs; if from heauen
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:176944:39"/> you shall looke down into the great Gulfe, and there see diuersitie of torments according to the value of sinnes. Equalitie of offences, you acknowledge an idle Paradox of the Stoicks: to holde vnequall sinnes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually punished, were more absurd, and more iniurious to Gods iustice: There is but one fire, which yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise burnes the straw, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise wood and yron. He that made and commands this dungeon, these tortures, telles vs that the wilfully disobedient shall smart with more stripes; the ignorant with fewer. Yet so conceiue of these heauenly degrees, that the least is glorious. So doe these vessels differ, that all are full: there is no want in any, no enuie. Let vs striue for a place, not striue for the order: How can we wish to be more than happie?</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:176944:40"/>
                     <p>Your other Question is of our mutual knowledge aboue; the hope whereof (you thinke) would giue much contentment to the necessitie of our parture: for both we are loth not to know those whom we loue; and we are glad to thinke we shall know them happy: whereof (if it may comfort you) I am no lesse confident. If I may not go so farre as with the best of the Fathers, to say wee shall know one anothers thoughts, I dare say, our persons we shall; our knowledge, our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory are not there lost, but perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: yea I feare not to say we shall know both our miseries past, and the present sufferings of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It makes our happinesse not a little the sweeter, to know that wee were miserable, to know that others are and must be miserable: we shall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176944:40"/> know them; not feele them: Take heed, that you cleerely distinguish betwixt speculation, &amp; experience. Wee are then farre out of the reach of euils: We may see them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, not to affect vs. Who doubts that these eies shall see, and know the glorious manhood of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour, aduanced aboue all the powers of heauen? And if one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, why not more? And if our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother, why no more of our spirituall fraternitie? Yea, if the twelue thrones of those Iudges of <hi>Israel,</hi> shall bee conspicuous; how shall wee not acknowledge them? And if these, who shall restraine vs from more? You will easily grant, that our loue can neuer faile: Faith and hope giue place to sight, to present fruition: for these are of things not seene; but loue is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176944:41"/> not of GOD onely, but his Saints: For nothing ceases, but our earthly parts, nothing but what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of corruption. Christian loue is a grace, and may well challenge a place in heauen: and what loue is there, of what we know not? More plainly, If the three Disciples in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> knew <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> how much more shall we know them in Gods <hi>Sion?</hi> Lastly, (for it is a letter, not a volume, that I intended in this not necessary, but likely discourse) that famous parable can tell you, that those which are in Hell, may know singular and seuerall persons, tho distant in place. The rich Glutton knowes <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> I heare what you say; It is but a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: neither will I presse you with the contrary authority of <hi>Ambrose, Tertullian, Gregory, Hierome,</hi> or any
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:176944:41"/> Father; nor with that vniuersal rule of <hi>Chrysostome;</hi> that those onely are parables, where examples are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and names concealed: I yeeld it; yet all holy parables haue their truths, at least their possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Denie this, and you disable their vse, wrong their Author. Our Sauiour neuer said ought was done, that cannot be; and shall then the damned retaine ought, which the glorified lose? No man euer held that the soule was aduantaged by torment. Comfort you therefore in this; you shall know, and bee knowen. But farre bee from hence all carnall and earthly thoughts; as if your affections should be (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) doubled to your wife or child. Nature hath no place in glory: heere is no respect of blood, none of marriage. This grosser acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:176944:42"/> and pleasure is for the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of Turkes, not the Heauen of Christians. Heere is as no marriage, (saue betwixt the Lambe and his Spouse the Church) so no matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall affections: You shall reioice in your glorified childe; not as your childe, but as glorified. In briefe, let vs so inquire of our companie, that aboue all things we striue to be there our selues, where we are sure, if we haue not what wee imagined, wee shall haue more than we could imagine.</p>

No man euer more truly held a Wolfe by the eare; which he can neither stay, nor let goe, with safety. Gods ancient Law would haue made a quicke dispatch, and haue determined the case, by the

With vs, the easinesse of reuenge, as it yeelds frequence of offenses, so multitude of doubts: Whether the wronged husband should conceale, or complain: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, whether he should retain, or dismisse: dismissing, whether he may marry, or must continue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle: not continuing single, whether he may receiue his owne, or chuse another: But your inquiries shalbe my bounds.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176944:44"/> Publike notice requires pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like discharge: Priuate wrongs are in our owne power: Publike, in the hands of authority.

I applaud the rigor of those ancient Canons, which haue stil roughly censured euen this cloak of vice: As there is a necessitie of charitie in the former, so of iustice in this.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N matter of sinne I dare not discommend much feare: Loosenes is both a more ordinary fault, and more dangerous, than excesse of care: yet heerein the minde may be vniustly tortured, &amp; suffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gaine. It is good to know our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176944:51"/> bounds, and keepe them; that so we may neither bee carelesly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue, nor needlesly afflicted. How farre wee may trauell to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse with Infidels, with Heretikes, is a long demand, and cannot bee answered at once. I see extremes on both hands, and a path of truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both, of no small latitude. First I commend not this course to you; it is well, if I allow it. The earth is large; and truth hath ample Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; and those not in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, not vnpleasant. To neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the maine blessings with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencie of the inferiour; for abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the inferiour, without the maine, were a choice vnwise and vnequall. While we are free, who would take ought but the best? Whither goe you? Haue we not as temperate a Sunne, as faire an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:176944:51"/> as fertile an Earth, as rich a sea, as sweet companions? What stand I on equalitie? a firmer peace, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Gospell, an happier gouernment than the world can shew you? yet you must goe: I giue you my allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but limited, and full of cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: like an inquisitiue Officer, you must let me aske, who, how, when, whither, why, how long, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly determine. To commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them in their false serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who will not spit at as impious? We speak of conuersing with men, not with idolatries: ciuilly, not in Religion: not in works of darknes, but businesse of commerce, and common indifferencies. Fie on those Rimmonites, that pleade an vpright soule in a prostrate bodie: Hypocrites, that pretend a <hi>Nathani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> in the skinne of a <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:176944:52"/> hates their secret halting, and will reuenge it. Let goe their vices; speake of their persons: Those may be conuersed with; not with famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie, not with intirenesse: as men qualified, not as friends. Traffique is heere allowed, not amitie; not friendship, but peace. <hi>Paul</hi> will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to feast at their table, not to frequent it: yet not this to all. Christianity hath all statures in it, all strengths: children, and men, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Giants. For a feeble vngroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Christian, this very companie is dangerous: safe for the strong and instructed. Turne a child loose into an Apothecaries shop, or an Idiot: that gally-pot which lookes fairest, shall haue his first hand, tho full of poisonous drugs: where the iudicious would chuse the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest, led not by sense, but skill.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:176944:52"/> Setlednesse in the trueth will cause vs to hate and scorne ridiculous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and that hate will settle vs the more; where the vnstayd may grow to lesse dislike, and indanger his owne infection. He had need be a resolute <hi>Caleb</hi> that should go to spie the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet not such a one, vpon euery occasion: meere pleasure or curiositie I dare not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in this aduenture. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of authoritie, or necessitie of traffique I can not reiect: Or if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sufficient preuention, desire to informe our selues thorowly in a forraigne religion, or state (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for publique vse) carry vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I censure not. In all matter of danger, a calling is a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and it can not want perill to goe vnsent: Neither is there small weight in the qualitie of the place,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176944:53"/> and continuance of the time. It is one ease where the profession of our religion is free, another where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained; perhaps not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint to idolatrie: where we haue meanes for our soules, an allowed Ministery, the case must needs differ from a place of necessarie blindnes, of peeuish superstition. To passe thorow an infected place is one thing, to dwell in it another: Ech of these giue a new state to the cause, and looke for a diuers answer. But as in all these outward actions, so here, most force (I confesse) lies in the intention; which is able to giue not tolleration onely to our trauell, but praise; to conuerse with them without, but in a purpose of their conuersion, and with indeuour to fetch them in, can be no other than an holy course: wherein that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:176944:53"/> haue been (by their owne say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) more seruiceable in their <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>China;</hi> let them thanke (after their number and leasure) their shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Spaine:</hi> the opportunitie of whose patronage hath preferr'd them to vs; not their more forward desires. In short, companying with Infidels may not be simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; who can holde so, that sees <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Israel</hi> with the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> with their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelechs;</hi> Roses among thornes, and pearles among much mud; and, for all, <hi>Christ</hi> among <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi> so wee neither be infected by them, nor they further infected by our confirmation; nor the weake Christian by vs infected with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, nor the Gospell infected with reproch; what danger can there be? If neither wee, nor they, nor the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:176944:54"/> weake, nor (which is highest) the Name of God be wronged; who can complaine? You haue mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, dispose now of your selfe as you dare: The earth is the Lords, and you are his; wheresoeuer he shall finde you, be sure you shall finde him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hiles I aduentured other characters into the light, I reserued one for you; whom I account no smal part of my ioy; The Character of <hi>VVhat you are,</hi> of <hi>VVhat you should be:</hi> Not that I arrogate to my selfe, more than ordinarie skill in these high points; I desire not to describe a Courtier: How should I, that haue but seene and saluted the seat of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:176944:55"/> Princes? Or why should I, whose thoghts are sequestred to the Court of heauen? But if I would decipher a good Courtier, who can heerein controll my indeuour? Goodnesse in all formes is but the iust subiect of our profession: what my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation could not, no lesse certaine rule shall afford me. Our Discourse hath this freedome, that it may reach beyond our eyes with beleefe. If your experience agree not with my speculation, distrust me. I care not for their barking, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me, at first, of incongruitie; as if these two termes were so disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that one sentence could not holde them. The Poet slanders, that abandons all good men from Courts. Who knowes not that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Court had a <hi>Moses;</hi> the Court of <hi>Samaria</hi> an <hi>Obadiah;</hi> of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>

I speake boldly, the Court is as nigh to Heauen as the Cell, and doth no lesse require, and admit strict holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I banish therefore hence all impietie, and dare presage his ruine whose foundation is not layed in goodnesse. Our Courtier is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than vertuous, and serues the God of heauen as his first Master, and from him deriues his dutie to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:176944:56"/> these earthen gods; as one that knowes the thrones of heauen and earth are not contrary, but subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, &amp; that best obedience springs from deuotion: his abilitie and will haue both conspired to make him perfectly seruiceable, and his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence waits but for an opportunity. In the factions of some great riualls of honor, he holds himselfe in a free neutrality, accounting it safer in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust frayes to looke on, than to strike; and if necessitie of occasion will needs winde him into the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, he chuses not the stronger part, but the better; resoluing rather to fall with innocence and truth, than to stand with powerfull iniustice. In the changes of fauours and frownes he changeth not; his sincere hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie beares him thorow all alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with wise boldnesse, if not with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:176944:56"/> successe: and when he spies clouds in the eyes of his Prince (which yet of long he will not seeme to see) his cleere heart giues him a cleere face; and if he may be admitted, his loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all breath shall soone dispell those vapors of ill suggestion: but if after all attempts of winde and Sunne he sees them setled, and the might of his accusers will not let him seeme as hee is; hee giues way in silence, without stomach, and waits vpon Time. Hee is not ouer-hastily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vpon his owne promotion, as one that seeks his Prince, not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and studies more to deserue than rise, scorning either to grow great by his owne bribes, ot rich by the bribes of others. His officious silence craues more than others words; and if that language be not heard, nor vnderstood, hee opens
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176944:57"/> his mouth, yet late and sparinglie; without bashfulnesse, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; caring only to motion, not caring to plead. He is affable and curteous, not vainly popular; abasing his Princes fauour to woe the worthlesse applause of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; approouing by his actions that he seekes one, not many; if not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one in many. His Alphabet is his Princes disposition; which once learned, hee plies with diligent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, not with flatterie; not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending euery action as good, nor the best too much; and in presence. When he finds an apparent growth of fauour, hee dares not glory in it to others, lest he should solicit their enuie, and hazzard the shame of his owne fall; but inioyes it in quiet thankfulnesse: not neglecting it, not drawing it on too fast: Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176944:57"/> forwardnesse argues no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie. How oft haue we knowen the weake beginnings of a likely fire scattered with ouer-strong a blast? And if another rise higher, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth not; onely emulating that mans merit, and suspecting his own. Neither the name of the Court, nor the grace of a Prince, nor applause of his inferiours, can lift him aboue himselfe, or lead him to affect any other than a wise mediocritie. His owne sincerity cannot make him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-credulous. They are few, and well tried, whom hee dares vse; or perhaps obliged by his own fauors: so in all imployments of friendship hee is wary without suspicion, and without credulitie charitable. He is free, as of heart, so of tongue, to speake what he ought, not what he might: neuer but (what Princes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:176944:58"/> eares are not alwaies inured to) meere Truth: yet that, tempered for the measure, and time, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest discretion. But if he meet with ought that might bee beneficiall to his master, or the state, or whose concealement might proue preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to either, neither feare nor gain can stop his mouth. He is not base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly querulous, not forward to spend his complaints on the disgraced, not abiding to build his own fauors vpon the vniust ruins of an oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fortune. The errours of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes he reports with fauour; their vertues with aduantage. Hee is a good husband of his houres; equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detesting idlenesse and base dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; and placing all his free time vpon ingenuous studies, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous delights; such as may make ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his body, or minde, more fit
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:176944:58"/> for noble seruice. He listeth not to come to counsell vncalled, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to intermeddle with secrets, whether of person, or state; which yet once imposed, hee manageth, with such fidelitie and wisdome, as well argue him to haue refrained, not out of feare, but iudgement: He knowes how to repay an iniurie with thankes, and a benefit with v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie; the one out of a wise patience without malicious closenesse; the other out of a bounteous thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. His life is his owne willing seruant, and his Princes free vassall; which he accounts lent to him, that he may giue it for his master: the intercepting of whose harmes hee holds both his duty, and honour; &amp; whether he be vsed as his sword, or his shield, hee doth both with cheerefulnesse. He can so demeane
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:176944:59"/> himselfe in his officious attendance, that hee equally auoids satiety and obliuion; not needlesly lauish of himselfe, to set out and shew his parts alwaies at the highest; nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully concealed in great occasions. Hee loues to deserue and to haue friends, but to trust rather to his owne vertue. Reason and honestie (next vnder religion) are his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers, which hee followes without care of the euent, not without fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight. In a iudgement of vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and enuie, he neuer casts the first stone, and hates to picke thanks by detraction. He vndertakes none but worthy sutes, such as are free from basenesse and iniustice; such as it neither shame to aske, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to grant; not suffring priuate affections to ouer-weigh publique equitie or conuenience; and better
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:176944:59"/> brooking a friends want, than an ill precedent; and those which he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to accept, he loues not to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in an afflicting hope: a present answer shall dispatch the feares or desires of his expecting client. His brest is not a cisterne to retaine, but as a conduit-pipe, to vent the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and honest petitions of his friend. Finally, hee so liues, as one that accounts not Princes fauors he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie; as one that will deserue their perpetuitie, but doubt their change; as one that knowes there is a wide world beside the Court, and aboue this world an heauen.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ndeed; wherein standes the vse of Wisdome, if not in tempering our pleasures and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes? and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing our selues in spight of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents, that the world may not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176944:62"/> blow vpon vs with an vnequall gale, neither tearing our sailes, nor slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them. Euents will varie; if we continue the same, it matters not: nothing can ouerturne him, that hath power ouer himselfe. Of the two, I confesse it harder to manage prosperitie, and to auoid hurt from good: strong and colde windes doe but make vs gather vp our cloake more round, more close; but to keepe it about vs in a hote Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine, to run and not sweat, to sweat and not faint; how difficult it is! I see some that auoid pleasures for their danger, and which dare not but abandon lawfull delights, for feare of sinne; who seeme to me like some ignorant Metallists, which cast away the precious Ore, because they can not separate the golde from the drosse; or some simple Iew, that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:176944:62"/> condemnes the pure streames of <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> because it falles into the dead sea. Why doe not these men refuse to eat, because meat hath made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gluttons? Or, how dare they couer themselues, that know there is pride in rags? These hard Tutors, if not Tyrants, to themselues, whiles they pretend a mortified strictnesse, are iniurious to their owne libertie, to the liberalitie of their Maker: Wherefore hath he created, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the choice commodities of this earth, if not for vse? Or why placed he Man in a Paradise, not in a Desert? How can we more displease a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall friend, than to depart from his delicate feast wilfully hungry? They are deceiued that call this holinesse; it is the disease of a minde sullen, distrustfull, impotent: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but euill, which is not from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:176944:63"/> heauen; and hee is none of Gods friends, that reiects his gifts for his owne abuse. Heare mee therefore, and true Philosophie; There is a neerer way than this, and a fairer: if you will be a wise Christian, tread in it. Learne first by a iust suruey, to know the due and lawful bounds of pleasure; and then beware, either to go beyond a knowen Mere, or in the licence of your owne desires, to remoue it. That God, that hath curb'd in the furie of that vnquiet and foaming element▪ and sayd of olde, <hi>Heere shalt thou stay thy proud waues,</hi> hath done no lesse for the rage of our appetite. Beholde, our limits are not obscure; which if wee once passe, our inundation is peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and sinfull. No iust delight wanteth either his warrant, or his termes. More plainly, be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:176944:63"/> both with the qualitie of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and the measure: Manie a soule hath lost it selfe in a lawfull delight, through excesse: and not fewer haue perished in those, whose nature is vicious, without respect of immoderation: Your care must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid both. The taste of the one is deadly, of the other, a full carouse: and in truth, it is easier for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, not to taste of that, than not to be drunke with this. The ill is more easily auoided, than the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent moderated. Pleasure is of a winding, and serpentine nature; admit the head, the bodie will aske no leaue: and sooner may you stop the entrance, than stay the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. Withall, her insinuations are so cunning, that you shall not perceiue your excesse, till you be sicke of a surfet: A little honie is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:176944:64"/> sweet; much, fulsome. For the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this temper, then, settle in your selfe a right estimation of that wherein you delight: resolue euery thing into his first matter, and there will be more danger of contempt, than ouer-ioying. What are the goodly sumptuous buildings we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, but a little burnt and hardned earth? What is the stately and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous building of this humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whose beautie wee dote vpon, but the same earth we tread on, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tempered; but worse, when it wants his guest? What are those precious mettals whom wee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but veines of earth better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured? What are costly robes, but such as are giuen of wormes, and consumed of moths? Then, from their beginning, looke to their end, and see laughter conclude in teares;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:176944:64"/> see death in this sweet pot. Thy conscience scourges thee with a long smart for a short libertie, and for an imperfect delight, giues thee perfect torment: Alas, what an hard penny-worth; so little pleasure for so much repentance! Inioy it, if thou canst; but if while the sword hangs ouer thee in an horses haire, still threatning his fall and thine, thou canst be securely iocund; I wonder, but enuy not. Now I heare you recall me, and after all my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course (as no whit yet wiser) inquire by what rule our pleasures shall be iudged immoderate? Wee are all friends to our selues, and our indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will hardly call any fauor too much. I send you not (tho I might) to your bodie, to your calling for this triall; while your delights ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not the presence, the fruition
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:176944:65"/> of God, you are safe: the loue of the medicine is no hinderance to the loue of health: let all your pleasures haue reference to the highest good, and you can not exceed. You see the Angels sent about Gods messa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to this earth, yet neuer out of their heauen, neuer without the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Maker. These earthly things cause not distraction, if wee rest not in them, if wee can looke thorow them, to their giuer. The minde that desires them for their owne sakes, and suffers it selfe taken vp with their sweetnesse as his main end, is alreadie drunken. It is not the vse of pleasure that offends, but the affectation. How many great Kings haue been Saints? They could not haue been Kings without choice of earthly delights; they could not haue been Saints with earthly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV haue receiued a proud challenge, and now holde your selfe bound vpon tearmes of honour, to accept it. Heare first the answer of a friend, before you giue an answer to your enemie; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the counsell of loue, ere you
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176944:67"/> enter those courses of reuenge: Thinke not you may reiect mee, because my profession is Peace; I speake from him, which is not only the Prince of Peace, but the God of Hosts; of whom if you will not learne to manage your hand and your sword, I shall grieue to see, that courage hath made you rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious. Grant once that you are a Christian, and this victory is mine; I ouercome, and you fight not: would God the furie of mens passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could be as easily conquered, as their iudgements conuinced; how manie thousands had beene free from blood! This conceit of false fortitude hath cost wel-neere as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny liues as lawfull warre, or, as opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of heresie. Let mee tell you with confidence, that all duels or single Combats are murderous;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:176944:67"/> blanche them ouer (how you list) with names of honour, and honest pretences; their vse is sinfull, and their nature diuellish.</p>
                     <p>Let vs two, if you please, (before hand) enter into these lists of words. Let reason (which is a more harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse fight) conflict with reason: Take whom you will with you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this field; of all the Philosophers, Ciuilians, Canonists; for Diuines (I hope) you shall finde none; and let the right of this truth be tried vpon a iust induction.</p>
                     <p>I only premise this caution, (lest wee quarrell about the cause of this quarrell) that necessitie must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from these vnlawfull fights; which euer alters their qualitie, and remoues their euill: The defense of our life, the iniunction of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, are euer excepted: voluntary
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:176944:68"/> combats are onely questioned; or whose necessitie wee doe not finde, but make. There are not many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that can draw vs foorth single into the field, with colour of equity. Let the first be the trial of some hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den right; whether of innocence vpon a false accusation, or of title to inheritance, not determinable by course of lawes. A proceeding not tolerable among Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it wants both warrant and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Where euer did God bid thee hazzard thy life for thy name? Where did hee promise to second thee? When thou art without thy commandement, without his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, thou art without thy prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He takes charge of thee, but when thou art in thy waies; yea in his. If this be Gods way, where did he chalke it out? If thou want his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:176944:68"/> word, looke not for his aid. Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is that man, which in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous actions, is left to his owne kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; yea how plainly doth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent shew Gods dislike? How oft hath innocence lien bleeding in these combats, and guiltinesse insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the conquest? Those very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals (whom we oft cite not, often trust not) report the inequalitie of this issue. Two men are brought to the barre, one accuses the other of theft, without further euidence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to cleere, or conuince: The sword is called for, both witnesse, and Iudge: They meet, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat: The innocent party is slaine: The stoll'n goods are found after in other hands, and confessed. O the iniustice of humane sentences! O wretched estate of the party miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried! His good name is lost with
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:176944:69"/> his life, which he would haue redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with his valour: hee both dies and sins, while hee striues to seeme cleere of a sinne. Therefore men say he is guilty, because he is dead, while the others wickednesse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with glory. I am deceiued, if in this case there were not three murderers; the Iudge, the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, himselfe. Let no man chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge God for neglect of innocence, but rather magnifie him for reuenge of presumption. What he inioynes, that he vndertakes, he maintaines: who art thou, ô vaine man, that da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest expect him a party in thine own braules? But there is no other way of triall: better none than this. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie or land is questioned; and now we send two men into the lists, to try whether is the better fencer: what is the strength of skill of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:176944:69"/> champians, to the iustice of the cause? Wherefore serue our owne oathes, where to witnesse, records, lotteries, and other purgations? Or why put we not men as well to the olde Saxon, or Liuonian, Ordalian trials of hote yrons, or scalding li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors? It is farre better some truths should be vnknowen, than vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully searched. Another cause see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly warrantable may be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of warre, preuention of common bloodshed: Two armies are ready to ioyne battell, the field is sure to be bloody on both sides; either part chuses a champian; they two fight for all: the life of one shall ransome a thousand. Our Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, our Lawyers shout for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of this Monomachy, as a way neere, easie, safe: I dare not: Either the warre is iust, or vniust: if vniust,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:176944:70"/> the hazzard of one is too much; if iust, too little. The cause of a iust warre must be, besides true, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; the title common, wherin stil a whole state is interessed; therefore may not, without rashnesse and tentation of God, be cast vpon two hands. The holy story neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords any, but a barbarous Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, to make this offer, and that in the presumption of his vnmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse. Profane monuments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port many, &amp; some on this ground wisely reiected. <hi>Tullus</hi> challenged <hi>Albanus,</hi> that the right of the two hosts might be decided by the two captaines; hee returned a graue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie (which I neuer read noted of cowardise) That this sute of honor stood not in them two, but in the two cities of <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All causes of publike right are
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:176944:70"/> Gods: when we put to our hand in Gods cause, then may we looke for his. In vaine we hope for successe, if we do not our vtmost; wherefore either warre must bee determined without swords, or with many: why should all the heads of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth stand vpon the necke and shoulders of one Champian? If he miscary, it is iniury to lose her; if he preuaile, yet it is iniury to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard her: yet respecting the parties themselues, I can not but grant it neerest to equitie, and the best of combats, that some blood should bee hazzarded, that more may bee out of hazzard. I descend to your case, which is yet further from like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of approofe; for what can you plead but your credit? others opinion? You fight, not so much against anothers life, as your owne
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:176944:71"/> reproch: you are wronged, and now if you challenge not; or you are challenged, and if you accept not, the world condemnes you for a coward; who would not rather hazzard his life, than blemish his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? It were well, if this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution were as wise as gallant. If I speake to a Christian, this courage must be rectified. Tell mee, what world is this, whose censure you feare? Is it not that, which God hath branded long agoe with <hi>Positus in maligno?</hi> Is it not that which hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer misconstrued, discouraged, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, persecuted goodnesse? That which reproched, condemned your Sauiour? What do you vnder these colours, if you regard the fauour of that, whose amitie is enmitie with God? What care you for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of him, whom you should both
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:176944:71"/> scorne and vanquish? Did euer wise Christians, did euer your Master al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low either this manhood, or this feare? Was there euer any thing more strictly, more fearefully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of him, than reuenge in the challenge; than in the answer, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euill; and murder in both? It is pity, that euer the water of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was spilt vpon his face, that cares more to discontent the world, than to wrong God: He sayth, <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine:</hi> and you steale it from him in a glorious theft, hazzarding your soule more than your bodie. You are weary of your selfe, while you thrust one part vpon the sword of an enemie, the other, on Gods. Yet, perhaps I haue yeelded too much. Let go Christians; The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser world of men (and who els are worth respect?) will not passe this
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:176944:72"/> odious verdict vpon your refusall: valiant men haue reiected challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with their honours vntainted. <hi>Augustus,</hi> when hee receiued a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and braue appointment of combat from <hi>Antony,</hi> could answer him, That if <hi>Antony</hi> were wearie of liuing, there were wayes enow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to death. And that Scythian King returned no other replie to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And <hi>Metellus</hi> challenged by <hi>Sertori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> durst answer scornfully, with his penne, not with his sword; That it was not for a Captaine to die a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers death. Was it not dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for these wise and noble Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to turne off these desperate offers? What law hath made it so with vs? Shall I seriously tell you? Nothing, but the meere opinion of some humorous gallants, that haue
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:176944:72"/> more heart than braine; confirm'd by a more idle custome: Worthie grounds, wheron to spend both life and soule; wheron to neglect God, himselfe, posteritie. Go now &amp; take vp that sword, of whose sharpnesse you haue boasted, and hasten to the field; whether you die or kill, you haue murdered. If you suruiue, you are haunted with the conscience of blood; if you die, with the torments; and if neither of these, yet it is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you would haue killed. See whether the fame of a braue fight can yeeld you a counteruailable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse of these mischiefs: how much more happily valiant had it been to master your selfe, to feare sin more than shame, to contemn the world, to pardon a wrong, to preferre true Christianitie, before idle manhood, to liue and do well!</p>

Other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans do but practise, we still learn;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:176944:74"/> others run still in the same gyre, to wearinesse, to satietie, our choice is infinite: other labours require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, our very labour recreats our sports: we can neuer want, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther somewhat to do, or somewhat that we would do. How number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse are those volumes which men haue written, of arts, of tongues! How endlesse is that volume which GOD hath written of the world! wherein euery creature is a letter, euery day a new page: who can be weary of either of these? To finde wit in Poetrie, in Philosophie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnesse, in Mathematikes acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in Historie wonder of euents, in Oratorie sweet eloquence, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie supernaturall light and holy deuotion; as so many rich mettals in their proper mines, whom would it not rauish with delight? After all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:176944:74"/> these, let vs but open our eyes, wee can not looke beside a lesson, in this vniuersall BOOKE of our Maker, worth our studie, worth taking out. What creature hath not his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle? what euent doth not challenge his obseruation? And if wearie of forraine imploiment we list to looke home into our selues, there we find a more priuate world of thoughts, which set vs on worke anew, more busily, not lesse profitable; now, our silence is vocall, our solitarinesse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and wee are shut vp, to doe good vnto many. And if once wee be cloyed with our owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the doore of conference is open; heere interchange of discourse (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides pleasure) benefits vs: and he is a weake companion, from whom we returne not wiser. I could enuy, if I could beleeue, that <hi>Anachoret,</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:176944:75"/> who secluded from the world, and pent vp in his voluntarie prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walles, denied that he thought the day long, whiles yet he wanted lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to varie his thoughts. Not to be cloyed with the same conceit, is difficult aboue humane strength; but to a man so furnished with all sorts of knowledge, that according to his dispositions he can change his studies, I should wonder, that euer the Sun should seeme to pace slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. How many busie tongues chase away good houres in pleasant chat, and complain of the haste of night! What ingenuous minde can be soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wearie of talking with learned Authours, the most harmlesse, and sweetest of companions? What an heauen liues a Scholar in, that at once in one close roome can dayly conuerse with all the glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:176944:75"/> and Fathers? That can single out, at pleasure, either sententious <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or graue <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Hierome,</hi> or flowing <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> or diuine <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or deuout <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> or (who alone is all these) hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <hi>Augustine,</hi> and talk with them, and heare their wise and holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, verdicts, resolutions: yea, (to rise higher) with courtly <hi>Esay,</hi> with learned <hi>Paul,</hi> withall their fellow-Prophets, Apostles: yet more, like another <hi>Moses,</hi> with God himselfe, in them both? Let the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne vs; while we haue these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, wee cannot enuy them: wee cannot wish our selues other than we are. Besides, the way to al other contentments is troublesome; the only recompence is in the end. To delue in the mines, to scorch in the fire for the getting, for the fining of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:176944:76"/> gold, is a slauish toile; the comfort is in the wedge; to the owner, not the laborers; where our very search of knowledge is delightsome. Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it selfe, is our life; from which wee would not bee barred for a World. How much sweeter then is the fruit of study, the conscience of knowledge? In comparison where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the soule that hath once tasted it, easily contemnes all humane comforts. Goe now ye worldlings, and insult ouer our palenesse, our needinesse, our neglect. Yee could not bee so iocund, if you were not ignorant: if you did not want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, you could not ouer-looke him that hath it: For mee, I am so far from emulating you, that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, I had as leue be a brute beast, as an ignorant rich man. How is it then, that those gallants, which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:176944:76"/> haue priuilege of blood and birth, and better education, doe so scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turne off these most manlie, reasonable, noble exercises of scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larship? An hauke becoms their fist better than a booke: No dogge but is a better companion: Any thing, or nothing, rather than what wee ought. O mindes brutishly sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all! Doe they thinke that GOD made them for disport? who euen in his Paradise, would not allow pleasure, without worke. And if for businesse; either of body, or minde: Those of the bodie are commonly seruile, like it selfe. The minde therefore, the minde onely, that honourable and diuine part is fittest to be imploied of those which would reach to the highest perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of men, and would bee more than the most. And what worke is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176944:77"/> there of the minde but the trade of a scholar, studie? Let mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fasten this probleme on our Schoole-gates, and challenge all commers in the defense of it; that, No Scholar can not be truly noble. And if I make it not good, let mee neuer bee admitted further than to the subiect of our question. Thus we doe well to congratulate to our selues, our owne happinesse; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will come to vs, it shall be our comfort, but more theirs; if not, it is enough that wee can ioy in ourselues, and in him in whom wee are that we are.</p>

It were pitie that you should not forgoe some in a better exchange. The sea neuer incrocheth vpon our shore, but it loseth elswhere: some we haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily fetch't into the folde of our Church, out of your wastes; some others (tho few, and scarse a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) we haue sent into their heauen.

Whither can not conceit lead vs? whether for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, or your credulitie? His death was fearelesse: I commend his stomach, not his minde.

Not for meere shame, against the euidence of so many tongues, eares, records. Your prosperitie, your numbers argue enough that a man may be a Papist in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and liue. If treason be your religion, who will wonder that it is capitall?

The only question is, Whether our King may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:176944:80"/> liue, and rule; whether you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from his blood, and not sin: Would you haue a man denie this, and not die? Would you haue a man thus dying honoured? Dare you approue that religion, which defends the fact, canonizes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?

Pardon you in this: Now it is growen a point of doctrinall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, to determine how farre the power of Peters successour may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: You may neither sweare, nor say your hands shall not be steep't in the blood of your true Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne;

His holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (as you hope) will take none such courses. Woe were vs, if our safetie depended vpon your hopes, or his mercies. Blessed be that God, which malgrè hath made and kept vs happie, and hath lift vs aboue our enemies. But what hope is there, that hee who chargeth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects not to sweare allegeance, will neuer discharge them from allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; that those who clamorously and shamelesly complaine to the world of our crueltie, will forbeare to sollicit others crueltie to vs? your hopes to you, to vs our securities.

Heere is looked for a settled acquaintance with God, and experience both of the proceedings of grace, and of the offers and repulses of tentations; which in vaine we shall hope to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage in other hearts, if we haue not found in our owne. To speake by aime, or rote, of repentance, of contrition, of the degrees of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and faith, is both harsh, and seldome when, not vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We trust those Physitians best, which haue tried the vertue of their drugs, esteeming not of those which haue only borrowed of their books.

Here must be continuall and inward exercise of mortification, and seuere Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, whereby the heart is held in due awe, and the weake flames of the spirit quickened, the ashes of our dulnesse blowen off; a practise necessary in him, whose deuotion must set many hearts on fire: Here must be wisdome, and inoffensiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of carriage, as of one that goes euer vnder monitours, and that knowes other mens indifferencies

If another mans children mis-carry, the parent is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied; if a Ministers, censured; yea, not our seruant is faultie without our blemish. In all these occasions (a miserie incident to vs alone) our griefe is our shame. To descend neerer vnto the sacred affaires of this heauenly trade; in a Minister, Gods Church is accounted both his house to dwell in, and his field to worke in; wherein (vpon the penaltie of a curse) he faithfully, wisely, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deuoutly deales with God for his people, with his people for and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:176944:87"/> from God. Whether hee instruct, he must doe it with euidence of the spirit; or whether he reproue, with courage and zeale; or whether hee exhort, with meeknesse, &amp; yet with power; or whether he confute, with demonstration of trueth, not with rage and personall maliciousnesse, not with a wilfull heat of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or whether hee admonish, with long suffering, and loue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice, and partialitie: in a word, all these he so doth, as he that desires nothing but to honor God, and saue men. His wisdome must discerne betwixt his sheepe and wolues; in his sheepe, betwixt the holesome and vnsound; in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, betwixt the weake and tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; in the tainted, betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, qualities, degrees of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and infection, and to all these
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:176944:88"/> he must know to administer a word in season. Hee hath Antidotes for all tentations, counsels for al doubts, euictions for all errours, for all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishings incouragements. No oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion from any altered estate of the soule may finde him vnfurnished: He must ascend to Gods Altar with much awe, with sincere and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deuotion; so taking, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, distributing his Sauiour, as thinking himselfe at table in heauen with the blessed Angels. In the meane time, as hee wants not a thankefull regard to the Master of the feast, so not care of the guests. The greatnesse of an offender may not make him sacrilegiously parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nor the obscuritie negligent. I haue sayd little of any of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and of some, nothing: yet enough, I thinke, to make you (if

There is nothing but those scales betwixt you and happinesse. Thinke not much that I espie in you what your selfe sees not. Too much neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse oft-times hindreth sight: and if for the spots of our owne faces we trust others eies, why not for our perfections? You are in heauen, and know it not: Hee that beleeues, is already passed from death to life: You beleeue, whiles you complaine of vnbeleefe. If you complained not, I should mis-doubt you more, than you doe your selfe, because you complaine. Secure and insolent
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:176944:90"/> presumption hath killed many, that breathes nothing but confidence, and safety; &amp; abandons al doubts, and condemnes them. That man neuer beleeued, that neuer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This liquor of faith is neuer pure in these vessels of clay, without these lees of distrust. What then? Thinke not that I encourage you to doubt more; but perswade you, not to bee discouraged with doubting. All vncertainty is comfortlesse: those that teach men to coniecture, and forbid to resolue, read lectures of misery. Those doubts are but to make way for assurance; as the oft-shaking of the tree, fastens it more at the root. You are sure of God; but you are afraid of your selfe. The doubt is not in his promise; but your application. Looke into your owne heart. How know you that

If a man, like your selfe, promise you ought, you know whether you trust him, whether you rely your selfe on his fidelitie. Why can you not know it in him that is God &amp; man? The difference is not in the act, but the obiect. But if these habits (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their inward and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature) seeme hard to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried; turn your eies to those open markes that cannot beguile you: How many haue bragg'd of their faith, when they haue embraced nothing but a vaine cloud of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption? Euery man repeats his Creed, few feele it, few practise it. Take two boughs in the dead of winter; how like is one wood to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? how hardly discerned?
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:176944:91"/> Afterwards, <hi>By their fruit you shall know them.</hi> That faith, whose nature was obscure, is euident in his effects. What is faith, but the hand of the soule? What is the dutie of the hand, but either to hold, or worke? This hand then holds Christ, works obedience and holinesse: and if this act of Apprehension be as secret, as the cause; since the closed hand hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth still what it holdeth; see the hand of faith open; see what it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and compare it with your owne proofe. Deny if you can (yet I had rather appeale to any Iudge, than your preiudiced selfe) that in all your needes, you can step bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the Throne of Heauen, and freelie powre out your enlarged heart to your God, and craue of him, whether to receiue what you want, or that you may want; what

God, as he is not, so he is not called a father without this. In vaine doth he pray, that can not call God father: No father, without the spirit of adoption; no spirit, without faith: without this, you may babble, you can not pray. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume you that you can pray, I dare conclude vpon my soule, <hi>You beleeue.</hi> As little as you loue your selfe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie if you can, that you loue God. Say that your Sauiour from heauen should aske you <hi>Peters</hi> question, could your soule returne any other answer, than <hi>Lord, thou knowest I loue thee?</hi> Why are you els in such awe to offend, that a world can not bribe you to sin? Why in such deep griefe when you haue sinned, that no

Why in such feruent desire of inioying his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence? why in such agony when you inioy it not? neither doth God loue you, neither can you loue God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith. Yet more, Doe you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly nourish any one sin in your brest; do you not repent of all? Do you not hate all, tho you can not leaue all; doe you not complaine that you hate them no more? Doe you not, as for life, wish for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and indeuour it? Nothing but faith can thus clense the heart; that like a good hus-wife sweeps all the foule corners of the soule, and will not leaue so much as one web in this roomie house. Trust to it, you can not hate sinne for it owne sake, and forsake it for Gods sake, without faith: the faithlesse hath had some remorse and feares, neuer

First then, away with all these wicked thoghts, these grosse deuotions, and with <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> bury all your strange Gods vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the oake of <hi>Shechem,</hi> ere you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to set vp Gods Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and without all mentall representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conceiue of your God pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, simply, spiritually; as of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute being, without forme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out matter, without composition; yea, an infinite, without all limit of thoughts. Let your heart adore a spirituall Maiestie, which it can not comprehend, yet knowes to bee; and, as it were, lose it selfe in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitenesse. Thinke of him, as not to be thought of, as one, whose wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:176944:95"/> is his iustice, whose iustice is his power, whose power is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; and whose wisdome, iustice, power, mercy is himselfe: as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out qualitie good, great without quantitie, euerlasting without time, present euery where without place, containing all things without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: and when your thoughts are come to the highest, stay there, and be content to woonder, in silence: &amp; if you can not reach to conceiue of him as hee is, yet take heed you conceiue not of him as hee is not. Neither wil it suffice your Christian minde, to haue this awfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused apprehension of the Deitie, without a more speciall and inward conceit of three in this one; three persons in this one essence, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, but distinguished; and not more mingled than diuided. There
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176944:96"/> is nothing, wherein the want of words can wrong and grieue vs, but in this: Here alone, as we can adore, and not conceiue; so wee can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and not vtter; yea, vtter our selues, and not be conceiued: yet as we may, Thinke heere of one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in three subsistences; one es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in three relations; one <hi>Iehouah</hi> begetting, begotten, proceeding; Father, Sonne, Spirit: yet so, as the Sonne is no other thing from the Father, but another person; or the Spirit from the Sonne. Let your thoughts heere walke warily, the path is narrow: the conceit either of three substances or but one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, is damnable. Let me leade you yet higher, and further, in this intricate way, towards the Throne of Grace: All this will not auaile you, if you take not your Mediator
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:176944:96"/> with you: if you apprehend not a true manhood, gloriously vnited to the Godhead, without change of either nature, without mixture of both; whose presence, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits must giue passage, acceptance, vigor, to your prayers.</p>
                     <p>Heere must be therefore (as you see) thoughts holily mixed: of a Godhead and humanitie: one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in two natures: of the same Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in diuers persons, and one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: wherin (if euer) heauenly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome must bestirre it selfe, in direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs, so to seuer these apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that none be neglected; so to conioyne them, that they be not confounded. O the depth of diuine mysteries, more than can be woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at! O the necessitie of this hie knowledge, which who attaine not, may babble, but prayeth not! Still
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:176944:97"/> you doubt, and aske if you may not direct your prayers to one person of three. Why not? Safely, and with comfort: What need wee feare, while we haue our Sauiour for our patterne: <hi>O my Father (if possible) let this Cup passe:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> euery where, both in thankes and requests: but with due care of worshipping all in one. Exclude the other, while you fix your heart vpon one, your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is sinne; retaine all, and mention one, you offend not. None of them doth ought for vs, without all. It is a true rule of Diuines: all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall works are common: To sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite one therfore, and not all, were iniurious. And if you stay your thoughts vpon the sacred humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Christ, with an inseparable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration of the Godhead vnited, and thence climbe vp to the holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:176944:97"/> of that blessed and dreadfull Trinitie, I dare not censure, I dare not but commend your diuine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Thus should Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from earth to heauen, from one heauen to another. If I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen your deuotions any light, it is well: the least glimpse of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is worth all the full gleames of humane and earthly skill. But I mistake, if your own heart wrought vpon with serious meditations (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that spirit of illumination) will not proue your best master. After this weake direction, studie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue aright, that you may pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and pray that you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and meditate that you may do both: and the God of heauen direct you, inable you, that you may do all.</p>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:176944:100"/> vpon euery of the Fathers, not without shamelesse importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and grosse impossibilities: all which (as shee said of <hi>Peter</hi>) their speech bewraieth; or (as <hi>Austen</hi> said of <hi>Cyprians</hi> stile) their face. This fraud is more easily auoided: For as in notorious burglairies, oft times there is either an hat, or a gloue, or a weapon left behinde, which descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the authors; so the God of truth hath besotted these impostors, to let fall some palpable error (tho but of false calculation) whereby, if not their names, yet their ages might appeare, to their conuiction. Most danger is in the secret corruption of the true, and acknowledged issue of those gracious parents; whom, through close and craftie handling, they haue induced to belie those that begot them; and to betray
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:176944:100"/> their Fathers, either with silence, or false euidence. Plainly, how are the honoured volumes of faithfull anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, blurred, interlined, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, depraued by subtle treacherie; and made to speak what they meant not? Fie on this, not so much iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as impietie, to race the awfull monuments of the dead; to blot and change the originall will of the deceased, and partially to insert our owne legacies. This is done by our guiltie aduersaries, to the iniury not more of these Authors, than of the present and succeding times. Hence those Fathers are some-where not ours: What wonder? while they are not themselues. Your industry hath offered (and that motion is liuely, and heroicall) to challenge all their learned and elegant pages, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury of corruption; to restore them
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:176944:101"/> to themselues, and to vs: that which all the learned of our times haue but desired to see done, you proffer to effect: your assay in <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Austen</hi> is happy, and iustly applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. All our Libraries, whom your diligent hand hath ransackt, offer their aid, in such abundance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, as al <hi>Europe</hi> would enuy to see met in one Iland. After all this, for that the most spightfull imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Truth is Noueltie, you offer to deduce her pedegree from those primitiue times, through the successions of all ages; and to bring into the light of the world many (as yet obscure) but no lesse certaine and authenticall Patrons, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued line of defence.

I speake of this sad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of pestilence. The Angell of God followes you, and you doubt whether you should flee. If a lion out of the forest should pursue you, you would make no question, yet could not he doe it vnsent. What is the difference? Both instruments of diuine reuenge; both threaten
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:176944:104"/> death; one by spilling the blood, the other by infecting it. Who knowes whether hee hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed your <hi>Zoar</hi> out of the lists of this destruction? You say, it is Gods visitation. What euill is not? It war haue wasted the confines of your countrey, you saue your throats by flight: Why are you more fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods immediate sword of pestilence? Very leprosie, by Gods law, requires a separation; yet no mortall sicknesse. When you see a noted leper proclame his vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the street, will you embrace him for his sake that hath stroken him, or auoid him for his sake that hath forbidden you? If you honor his rod, much more will you regard his precept. If you mislike not the affliction because he sends it, then loue the life which you haue of his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:176944:104"/> sending; feare the iudgement which he will send, if you loue it not. He that bids vs flee when we are perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, hath neither excepted Angel nor man; whether soeuer, I feare our guiltinesse, if wilfully wee flee not. But whither shall we flee from God? say you: where shall he not both find and lead vs? whither shall not our destinie follow vs? Vaine men, we may run from our home, not from our graue; Death is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, our time is set; we can not, God will not alter it. Alas, how wise we are to wrong our selues! Because death will ouertake vs, shall we run and meet him? Because Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is sure, shall wee be desperate? Shall wee presume, because GOD changeth not? Why do we not trie euery knife and cord, since our time is neither capable of preuention nor
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:176944:105"/> delay: our end is set, not without our meanes. In matter of danger where the end is not knowen, the meanes must bee suspected; in matter of hope where the end is not knowen, meanes must be vsed. Vse then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the meanes of your flight, suspect the danger of your stay; and since there is no particular necessitie of your presence, know that God bids you depart and liue. You vrge the instance of your Minister: How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally? There is not more lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in your flight, than sin in ours: you are your own, we our peoples; you are charged with a body, which you may not willingly leese, not hazard by staying; we with all their soules, which to hazard by absence, is to lose our owne; wee must loue our liues, but not when they are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals with our soules, or with others.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:176944:105"/> How much better is it to be dead, than negligent, than faithlesse! If some bodies be contagiously sicke, shall all soules be wilfully neglected? There can be no time wherin good counsell is so seasonable, so needfull. Euery threatning findes impression, where the mind is prepared by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible iudgements. When will the iron hearts of men bow, if not when they are heat in the flame of Gods affliction? Now then, to run away from a necessarie and publike good, to auoid a doubtfull and priuate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is to run into a worse euill than we would auoid. He that will thus run from <hi>Niniue</hi> to <hi>Tharsis,</hi> shall find a Tempest and a Whale in his way. Not that I dare be an Author to any of the priuate visitation of infected beddes: I dare not, without better warrant. Who euer said wee were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:176944:106"/> bound to close vp the dying eyes of euery departing Christian? and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what euer conditions, to heare their last groanes? If we had a word, I would not debate of the successe. Then, that were cowardlines, which now is wisdome. Is it no seruice, that wee publiquely teach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort? that we priuatly prepare men for death, and arme them against it? that our comfortable letters, and messages stir vp their fainting harts? that our loud voices pierce their eares afarre; vnlesse wee feele their pulses, and leane vpon their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and whisper in their eares? <hi>Daniel</hi> is in the lions denne; Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that <hi>Darius</hi> speaks comfort to him thorow the grate, vnlesse he go in to salute him among those fierce companions? A good Minister is the common goods, hee can not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:176944:106"/> make his life peculiar to one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iniurie to many. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause of the Church, he must be no niggard of his life; in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate cause of a neighbours bodily sicknesse, he may soon be prodigall. A good father may not spend his substance on one child, &amp; leaue the rest beggers. If any man be resolute in the contrary, I had rather praise his courage, than imitate his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. I confesse, I feare; not so much death, as want of warrant for death.</p>

It is true: There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any age not complained of; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any that was not censured, as worst. What is, we see; what was, we neither inquire, nor care. That which is out of sight and vse, is soon out of minde, and ere long out of memory. Yet the iniquity of others
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:176944:108"/> can not excuse ours. And if you wil be but as iust as charitable, you shall confesse, that both some times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others in euill, and these, all. This earthlie Moone the Church hath her fulles and wanings, and sometimes her eclypses; whiles the shadow of this sinfull masse hides her beauty from the world.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:176944:108"/> giues height to sinne: therefore are wee worse than our predecessours, because wee might bee better. By how much our meanes are greater, by so much are our defects. Turne ouer all Records, and parallell such helpes, such care, such cost, such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, with such fruit, I yeeld: We see but our owne times: There was neuer but one <hi>Noah</hi> (whom the heathens celebrated vnder another name) that with two faces saw both before, and behinde him: But loe, that Ancient of daies, to whom all times are present, hath told vs, that these last shall be worst: Our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience iustifies him, with all but the wilful. This censure (lest you should condemne my rigour, as vnnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partiall) is not confined to our seas, but; free and common, hath the same bounds with the earth. I
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:176944:109"/> ioy not in this large society. Would God wee were euill alone. How few are those, whose carriage doth not say, that profession of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is pusillanimitie? How few that care so much, as to shew well? And yet of those few, how many care only to seeme? whose words disagree from their actions, &amp; their hearts from their words? Where shall a man mew vp himselfe, that he may not be a witnesse of what he would not? What can hee see, or heare, and not bee either sad, or guilty? Oathes striue for number with words; scoffes with oaths, vain speeches with both. They are rare hands, that are free either from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersions of blood, or spots of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse.

Who knows not, that as the earth is the dregs of the world, so <hi>Italy</hi> is the dregs of the earth, <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>Italy?</hi> It is no wonder to finde Satan in his hell; but to find him in Paradise, is vncouth, and grieuous. Let them alone, that will die, and hate to be cured. For vs: O that remedies were as easy as complaints! That wee could be as soone cleared, as conuinced! That the taking of the medicine were but so difficult as the prescription! And yet nothing hinders vs from health, but our will: Neither Gospell, nor Grace, nor Glory, are shut vp; only our hearts are not open. Let mee turne my stile from you, to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, to the peruerse: tho why doe I hope they will heare mee, that are deafe to God? they will regard
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:176944:110"/> words, that care not for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Let mee tell them yet (if in vaine) they must break, if they bow not: That if mercy may be refused, yet vengeance cannot bee resisted: That God can serue himselfe of them perforce, neither to their thanke, nor ease: That the present plagues doe but threaten worse. Lastly, that if they relent not, Hell was not made for nothing. What should be done then? Except wee would fain smart, each man amend one, and we all liue. How common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do men complaine, and yet adde to this heape? Redresse stands not in words. Let euery man pull but one brand out of this fire, and the flame will goe out alone. What is a multitude, but an heap of vnities? The more we deduce, the fewer we leaue. O how happy were it then,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176944:111"/> if euery man would begin at home, and take his owne heart to task, and at once bee his owne Accuser, and Iudge; to condemne his priuate er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, yea to mulct them with death! Till then, alas, what auailes it to talke? While euery man censures, and no man amends, what is it but busie trifling? But tho our care must begin at our selues, it may not end there. Who but a <hi>Cain</hi> is not his brothers keeper? Publike persons are not so much their owne, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are theirs. Who sits at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sterne, cannot distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the care of his owne safety, and his vessels: both drown at once, or at once salute the hauen. Ye Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates (for in you stand all our lower hopes) whom God hath on purpose, in a wise surrogation, set vpōn earth, to correct her disorders,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:176944:111"/> take to your selues firme forheads, couragious hearts, hands busie, and not partiall; to discountenance shamelesse wickednesse, to resist the violent sway of euills, to execute holesome lawes, with strictnesse, with resolution. The sword of the spirit meets with such iron hearts, that both it enters not, and is reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Loe, it appeales to your arme, to your aide. An earthen edge can best pierce this hardned earth: If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity die not by your hands, wee perish. And yee sons of <hi>Leui</hi> gather to your <hi>Moses</hi> in the gate of the Campe: consecrate your hands to God in this holy slaughter of vice: Let your voice be both a trumpet to incite, and a two edged sword to wound and kill. Cry down sinne in earnest, and thunder out of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred chaire of <hi>Moses;</hi> and let your
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:176944:112"/> liues speake yet louder. Neither may the common Christian sit still and looke on in silence: I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, if in this cause GOD allow any man for priuate. Heere must bee all Actors, no Witnesses. His discreete admonitions, seasonable reproofes, and praiers neuer vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, besides the power of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest example, are expected as his due tribute to the common health: What if we cannot turn the stream? Yet wee must swim against it: euen without conquest, it is glorious to haue resisted: In this alone, they are enemies, that doe nothing: Thus, as one that delights more in amendment, than excuse, I haue both censured and directed. The fauour of your sentence proceedes (I know) from your owne innocent vprightnesse: So iudge of my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:176944:112"/> taxation. It shall bee happie for vs, if we can at once excuse and diminish; accuse and redresse ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. Let but the indeuor be ours, the successe to God.</p>

                     <p>It is not so much their zeale
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176944:121"/> for falshood; which yet wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and admire not. If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan were not more busie then they, we had lost nothing. Their desperate attempts, bold intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, importunate solicitations haue not returned empty; yet their policy hath done more then their force. That Popish world was then foule, and debauched, as in doctrine, so in life; and now beganne to be ashamed of it selfe; when these holy Fathers, as some Saints drop't out of heauen, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly professed an vnusuall strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sad piety, resolued mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and so drew the eyes, and hearts of men after them, that poore soules beganne to thinke it could not be other then diuine, which they taught; other then holy, which they touched. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176944:121"/> very times (not seldome) giue as great aduantage, as our owne best strength: and the vices of others giue glory to those which eyther are, or appeare vertuous. They saw how ready the world was to bite at the baite, and now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their successe, with new helps. Plenty of pretended miracles must blesse on all sides, the indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of this new Sect; and calls for both approbation, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Those things by the report of their owne pennes (other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses I see none) haue beene done by the ten Patriarcks of the Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Religion, both aliue and dead, which can hardly bee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of him, whose name they haue vsurped. And now the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar can say, If these men were not of God, they could doe nothing:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176944:122"/> How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? not distrusting either the fame, or the worke, but applauding the Authors, for what was said to bee done. But now lest the enuie of the fact should surpasse the wonder, they haue learned to cast this glory vpon their woodden Ladies, &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the gaine vnto the whole Religion: Two blocks at <hi>Hale</hi> and <hi>Scherpen-heuuell,</hi> haue saide and done more for Popery, then all Fryers, euer since <hi>Francis</hi> wore his breeches on his head. But because that praise is sweete, which arises from the disgrace of a riuall, therefore this holy society hath besides, euer wont to honor it selfe by the brokage of shameles vntruthes against the aduerse part; not caring how probable any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176944:122"/> is, but how odious. A iust volume would not containe those willing lies, wherewith they haue purposely loded religion, and vs; that the multitude might first hate vs, and then enquire: and these courses are helde not tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but meritorious. So the ende may be attayned, all meanes are iust; all wayes straight. VVhom we may, we satisfie: but wounds once giuen, are hardly healed with out some scarres: and commonly accusations are vocall, Apologies dumbe. How easie is it to make any cause good, if we may take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of tongue, and conscience? Yet lest some glimpse of our truth and innocence should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lighten the eyes of some more inquisitiue Reader, they haue by strict prohibitions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176944:123"/> of bookes, or conference, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained all possibility of true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations; Yea their owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, wherein our opinions are reported with confutation, are not alowed to the common view, lest if it should appeare what we hold, our meere opinion should preuaile more then their subtilest answere. But aboue all, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of Gods booke hath gained them most; If that might be in the hands of men, their religion could not be in their hearts; now, the concealement of Scriptures breeds ignorance, and ignorance superstition. But because forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance doth but whet desire, and worke a conceite of some secret excellence in things denyed; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue they deuised to affright this dangerous curiosity, with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:176944:123"/> that cruell, butcherly, hellish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition; Wherein yet there is not lesse craft then violence. For since they haue perceiued the blood of Martyrs to bee but the seed of the Church, and that these perfumes are more dispersed with beating; they haue now learned to murder without noyse, and to bring forth (if, at least, they list sometimes to make the people priuie to some examples of terror) not men but carcasses. Behold, the constant confessions of the dying Saints haue made them weary of publique executions: None but bare walls shalll now testifie the courage and faith of our happy Martyrs. A disguised corps is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought forth to the multitude either for laughter, or feare. Yet because the very dead speake for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:176944:124"/> truth in a loude silence; these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles are rare; and the graues of heretickes are become as close as their death.</p>
                     <p>Yet lest (since neither liuing mouthes, nor faithfull pens may be suffered to insinuate any truth) those speeches should perhaps be receiued from the Ancients, which in vs were hereticall; the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vnpartial antiquity must be depraued, all witnesses that might speake against them must be corrupted, with a fraudulent violence; and some of them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the death. So whiles ours are debarred, and the Ancients al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, posteritie shal acknowledge no aduersarie.</p>
                     <p>What should I speake of those plausible deuices; which they haue inuented to make superstitious,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:176944:124"/> and foolish Proselytes? Their proud vaunts of antiquity, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersality, succession, and the name of their fore-fathers, doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade, but amaze, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sot an ignorant heart. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious shews of their processions, the gaudy ornaments of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, the pompe and magnificence of the places, and maner of their Seruices, the triumphes of their great Festiuals, are enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch any childish, simple, or vaine beholders. VVho knowes not that nature is most led by sense? Sure, children and fooles (such are all meere naturall men) cannot be of any other religion.</p>
                     <p>Besides all these, their personall vndertakings, what for cunning, what for boldnes, could promise nothing but successe. They can
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:176944:125"/> transforme themselues into all shapes; and in these false formes thrust themselues into al Courts, and companies; not oftner chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their habit, then their name. They can take the best opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to worke vpon those which are either most vnable to resist, or most like to bestead them. That I may not speake of the wrongs of vnseasonable trauell: wherein many vnsettled heads haue met dangers, and solicited errors who like fond and idle Dinahs, going abroad to gaze, haue beene raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed ere they returne. Neuer any bird was so laide for, by the nets and cals of the fowler, as the great heire of some noble family, or some fiery wit, is by these impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. They know that greatnesse is both lawlesse, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:176944:125"/> if not by precept, yet by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: their very silence is persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory, and imperious. But alas for that other sexe: Still the diuel begins with <hi>Eue;</hi> still his assault is strongest, where is weakest resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, Nicholas</hi> the Deacon had his <hi>choros foemineos</hi> (as <hi>Hierome</hi> cals them) <hi>Marcion</hi> had his <hi>Factoresse</hi> at Rome; <hi>Appelles</hi> his <hi>Philumena, Montanus</hi> his <hi>Prisca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla; Arrius</hi> his <hi>Constantines-sister; Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his <hi>Lucilla, Elpidius</hi> his <hi>Agape, Priscillianus</hi> his <hi>Galla:</hi> and our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites haue their painted Ladies (not dead, but liuing) both for obiects and instruments. VVhen they saw they could not blow vp religion with French powder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, they now try by this Moabitish plot to sinke it downe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:176944:126"/> to hell. Those silly women, which are laden with sinnes, and diuers lusts, must now bee the stales of their spiritual fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But for that these enterprises want not danger; that both parts may securely succeede, beholde publike liberty of dispensations, whether for dissembled religion, or not vnprofitable filthinesse. These meanes are (like the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) dishonest, and godlesse. Adde (if you please) hereto, those which pretend more innocent policy: their common dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon one commaunder, their intelligences giuen, their charges receiued, their rewards and honors (perhaps of the Calender, perhaps of a red hat) duely conferred. Neither may the least helpe be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the conference of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176944:126"/> (the conioyned labours of whole Societies directed to one and, and shrouded vnder the title of one Author:) to large mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, raised from the death-beds of some guilty benefactors: from whence flow both infinite numbers, and incomparable helpes of Students. Vnder which head, for the time past, not a fewe are mooued by the remembrance of the bounteous hospitality of the religious; who hauing ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the world to themselues, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med liberal in giuing something; like vnto some vaineglorious theeues, which hauing robbed wealthy Merchants, bestow some pence vpon beggars. Further, the smothering, if not composing of their frequent strifes, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of brawles within their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176944:127"/> owne thresholds; with the nice menaging of their knowne op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, hath wonne many ignorant friends. Lastly, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent correspondence of their doctrines vnto nature, hath been their best solicitor. Wee haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined particulars in a former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle: wherein we haue made it euident, that Popery affects no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to make nature either proud, or wanton: it offers diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but carnall; and such as the greatest louer of himselfe would easily imbrace for an aduantage. That we may therefore summe vp all; I neede not accuse our careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, indifferency, idlenesse, loose carriage; in all which, would God we had not aided them, and wronged our selues; Nor yet their zeale and forwardnesse; worse
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176944:127"/> meanes are guily of their gaine. In short, the faire outside which they set vpon Religion, which sure is the best they haue, if not all; their pretended miracles, wilfull vntruths, strait prohibitiōs, bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; secret inquisitiōs, deprauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Ancient witnesses, expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their owne; gay and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish sights, glorious titles, crafty changes of names, shapes, habits, conditions; insinuations to the great oppugnation of the weaker sexe; falshood of answers, and oathes, dispensatons for sinnes, vniting of forces, concealing of differences, largenesse of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, multitude of actors, and meanes, accordances to mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dispositions: Where wee on the contrary care not to seeme but to bee, disclaime miracles,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176944:128"/> dare not saue the life of religion with a lie; giue free scope to all pennes, to all tongues, to all eyes: shed no blood for religion: suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer al writers to speake like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; shew nothing but poore simplicity in our deuotions, goe euer, and looke as wee are; teach the truth right-downe in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest plainenesse, take no vantage of imbecillity sweare true, though we die; giue no hope of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for euill, studie each retyred to himselfe, &amp; the muses; publish our quarrels and aggrauate them, anger nature, and conquer it. Such gaine shall be grauell in their throates: such losses to vs (in our not daring to sinne) shall bee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and victorious; in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards are both blame worthy, and recouerable. What dulnesse is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:176944:128"/> this? Haue we such a King, as in these lists of Controuersie, may dare to grapple with that great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Vicar, for his triple crown.

The very next age to these Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Patriarcks, neither would nor durst haue so much varied her rites, or augmented them; if it had found it selfe tyed either to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or kind: As yet it was pure, chast, and (which was the ground of all) persecuted.

I cannot but commend those very Nouatian Bishops (though it is a wonder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precedent of peace should fall from schismaticks) who meeting in Councel together, enacted that Canon of indifferency, when the Church was distracted with the differences of her Paschall solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; conluding how insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:176944:133"/> this cause was to disquiet the Church of Christ. Their owne issue (our Separatists) will needes be vnlike them in good; and striue to a further distance from peace: whiles in a conceit not lesse idle, thē scrupulous, they presse vs to an vniforme cōformity in our fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Apostles. Their owne practise condemnes them: They call for some, and yet keepe not all: yet the same reason enforces all, that pleads for some: and that which warrants the forbearance of some, holds for all. Those tooles which serue for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are not of vse for the roof. Yea the great master builder chose those workmen for the first stones which he meant not to imploy in the walls. Doe wee not see all Christs first agents extraordinary

The highest thing in a man is his owne spirit; but in a Christian the spirit of God, which is the God of spirits. No grace is wanting in him;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176944:136"/> &amp; those which there are, want not stirring vp. Both his hart &amp; his hands are cleane: All his outward purity flowes from within; neither doth he frame his soul to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait good actiōs, but out of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispositiō, commands and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them, in the sight of God. Let vs begin with his beginning, and fetch the Christian out of his nature, as another <hi>Abraham</hi> from his Chaldea: whiles the wordling liues and dies, in nature, out of God. The true conuert therfore after his wilde and secure courses puts himselfe (through the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gods spirit) to schoole vnto the lawe; there he learnes what he should haue done, what hee could not do, what he hath done, what he hath deserued. These les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, cost him many a stripe, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176944:137"/> many a teare, and not more griefe then terror: For this sharpe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster makes him feele what sinne is, and what hell is: and in regard of both, what himselfe is. When he hath well smarted vnder the whip of this seuere vsher, and is made vile enough in himselfe, then is he led vp into the higher schoole of Christ, &amp; there taught the comfortable lessons of grace; there he learnes, what belongs to a Sauiour, what one hee is, what he hath done, and for whom, how he became ours, we his; &amp; now fin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding himselfe in a true state of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of humilitie, of neede, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, of fitnes for Christ, he brings home to himself al that he learns, and what he knowes he applies. His former Tutor he feared, this hee loueth; that shewed him his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176944:137"/> wounds, yea made them: this binds and heales them: that killed him, this shewes him life, and leades him to it. Now at once he hates himselfe, defies Satan, trusts to Christ, makes account both of pardon and glory. This is his most precious Faith, whereby he appropriates, yea ingrosse Christ Iesus to himselfe: whence hee is iustified from his sinnes, purified from his corruptions, established in his resolutiōs, comforted in his doubts, defended against tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ouercomes all his enemies. Which vertue, as it is most imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and most opposed, so carries the most care from the Christian hart, that it be sound, liuely, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Sound, not rotten, not hollow not presumptuous: sound in the Act; not a superficiall conceit, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176944:138"/> a true, deepe, and sensible appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension; an apprehension, not of the braine, but of the heart, and of the heart not approuing, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, but trusting, and reposing Sound in the obiect, none but Christ: he knows, that no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in heauen can do him good, without this; The Angells can not: God will not: Ye beleeue in the Father, beleeue also in me.</p>
                     <p>Liuely; for it cannot giue life, vnlesse it haue life; the faith that is not fruitfull is dead: the fruits of faith are good workes: whether inward, within the roofe of the heart, as loue, awe, sorrow, piety, zeale, ioy, and the rest; or outward towards God, or our bretheren: obedience and seruice to the one: to the other reliefe and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: These he beares in his time:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176944:138"/> sometimes all, but alwayes some.</p>
                     <p>Growing: true faith cannot stand still, but as it is fruitfull in workes, so it increaseth in degrees; from a little seede it proues a large plant, reaching from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and from one heauen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: euery showre and euery Sun addes something to it. Neither is this grace euer solitary, but alwaies attended royallie: For hee that beleeues what a Sauiour hee hath, cannot but loue him: &amp; he tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> loues him cannot but hate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer may displease him: cannot but reioice in him, &amp; hope to inioy him, and desire to enioy his hope, and contemne all those vanities which he once desired and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His minde now scorneth to grouel vpon earth, but soareth vp to the things aboue, where Christ
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:176944:139"/> sits at the right hand of God: and after it hath seene what is done in heauen, looks strangely vpon al worldly things. He dare trust his faith aboue his reason, and sense: and hath learned to weane his appetite from crauing much: Hee stands in awe of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and dare no more offend it, then not displease himselfe. Hee feares not his enemies, yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects them not, equally auoiding security, and timorousnesse: Hee sees him that is inuisible; and walks with him awfully, famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly. He knowes what he is borne to, and therefore digests the miseries of his wardship, with patience: hee findes more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his afflictions, then any worldling in pleasures. And as hee hath these graces to comfort
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:176944:139"/> him within, so hath hee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to attend him without; spirits better then his owne, more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, more glorious; These beare him in their armes, wake by his bed, keepe his soule while hee hath it, and receiue it when it leaues him. These are some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent differences, the greatest are future, which could not bee so great, if themselues were not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; no lesse then betwixt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and hell, torment and glory, an incorruptible crowne, and fire vnquēchable. Whether Infidels be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leeue these things or no, we know them: so shall they, but too late. What remaynes but that wee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud our selues in this happines; &amp; walke on clearly in this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professiō? acknowledging that God could not do more for vs; &amp;

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:176944:141"/> spirituall priuiledges; desiring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to satisfie you in what you hard as a witnesse; not in what you needed as a mother. Children are the blessings of Parents, and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is the blessing of children, and parents: Wherein, there is not only vse, but necessity; Nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssity, not in respect so much of the end, as of the precept: God hath enioyned it, to the comfort of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and behoofe of children: which therefore, as it may not be superstitiously hastened, so not negligently differred. That the contempt of baptisme damneth, is past all doubt; but that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained absence thereof, should send infants to hel, is a cruell rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It is not their sinne to die early: death is a punishment, not an offence; an effect of sinne, not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:176944:141"/> a cause of torment; they want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but time; which they could not cōmand. Because they could not liue a while longer, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should die euerlastingly, is the hard sentence of a bloody religion. I am onely sorry, that so harsh an opinion should bee gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the name of a father, so re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerend, so diuine: whose sentence yet, let no man pleade by halues. He who helde it vnpossible for a child to be saued vnlesse the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismall water were powred on his face, held it also as vnpossible, for the same infant, vnlesse the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mētal bread were receiued into his mouth. There is the same ground for both, the same error in both, a weaknes fit for forgetfulnes; see yet how ignorāt, or il meaning posteri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, could single out one half of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:176944:142"/> opinion for truth and condemne the other of falshood. In spight of whom, one part shall easily conuince the other; yea without al force, since both cannot stand, both will fall together, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The same mouth, which said, vnlesse ye be borne againe of water, and the holy Ghost, said also, Except yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood: An equall neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of both. And lest any one should plead different interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the same Saint <hi>Austin</hi> auerres this later opinion also, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the necessary communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of children, to haue beene once the common iudgement of the Church of Rome: A sentence so displeasing,<note place="margin">Index Expurg.</note> that you shall finde the memory of it noted with a

                     <p>Yea what an aduenture was it in some, to adiourne it till their age (with <hi>Constantine</hi>) if being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their life, they had beene sure the preuention of death wold haue inferred damnation? Looke vnto that legall Sacrament of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, which (contrary to the fancies of our Anabaptists) directly answeres this Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Before the eight day they could not bee circumcised: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:176944:143"/> the eight day they might die. If dying the seuenth day, they were necessarily condemned: ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the want of a day is a sinne, or God sometimes condemneth not for sin: Neither of them pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, neither according with the iustice of the Law giuer. Or if from this parallell, you please to looke either to reason or example, the case is cleare. Reason; No man that hath saith; can bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for Christ dwels in our harts by faith: and he in whom Christ dwels cannot bee a reprobate. Now it is possible a man may have a sauing faith, before baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. <hi>Abraham</hi> first beleeued to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification: then ofter receiued the signe of circumcision, as a feale of the righteousnes of that faith, which he had when he was vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:176944:143"/> Therefore some dying before their baptisme, may, yea must be saued. Neither was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> case singular; he was the Father of all them also, which beleeue, not being circumcised: these, as they are his Sons in faith, so in righteousnesse, so in saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: vncircumcision cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where faith admitteth; These following his steps of beleefe: before the sacrament, shal doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse rest in his bosome, without the sacrament; without it, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally absent, not as willingly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. It is not the water, but the faith: not the putting away the filth of the flesh (saith Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) but the stipulation of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; for who takes Baptisme without a ful faith (saith <hi>Hierome</hi>) takes the water, takes not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176944:144"/> VVhence is this so great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the water, that it should touch the body, and cleanse the heart (saith <hi>Austen</hi>) vnlesse by the power of the word, not spoken, but beleeued? Thou seest water (saith <hi>Ambrose:</hi>) euery water heales not, that water onely heals which hath the grace of God annexed; And if there bee any grace in the water (saith <hi>Basill</hi>) it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence of the spirit. Baptisme is indeed, as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> stiles it, the paune and image of our resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea (as <hi>Basil</hi>) the power of God to resurrectiō: but (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> expoundes this phrase aright) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in his death, wee are by baptisme made partakers of his resurrection. Baptisme therefore without faith cannot saue a man,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176944:144"/> and by faith doth saue him; and faith without baptisme (where it cannot be had; not where it may be had, and is contemned) may saue him: That Spirit which workes by meanes, will not bee tyed to meanes.</p>
                     <p>Examples. Cast your eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that good theefe: good in his death, though in his life abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: hee was neuer washed in Iordan, yet is receiued into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; his soule was foule with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and iniustice, yea bloody with murders: and yet being scou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely with the blood of his Sauiour, not with water of baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; it is presented glorious to God. I say nothing of the soules of Traian, and <hi>Falconella,</hi> meere heathens, liuing and dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, without baptisme:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:176944:145"/> which yet their honest Legend reports deliuered from hell, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to heauen, not so much as scorched in Purgatorie: The one by the prayers of <hi>Gregory,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Tecla.</hi> VVhat partiality is this to deny that to the children of Christians, which they grant to knowne infidels? The promise is made to vs, and our seed; not to those that are without the pale of the Church. Those Innocents which were massacred for Christ, are by them canonized for Saints, and make one day in their Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar (each yeare) both holy, and dismall; whereof yet scarce any liued to know water, none to know baptisme. Yea, all Martyrs are here priuiledged; who are Christened in their owne blood, instead of water: but where hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:176944:145"/> God saide, All that die without baptisme, shall die for euer, except Martyrs? why not, except belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? It is faith that giues life to Martyrs; which if they should want, their first dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h could not auoyde the second. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doubted not to say, his <hi>Valentinian</hi> was baptised, because hee desired it; not because he had it: he knew the minde of God, who accounts vs to haue what we vnfaynedly wish.</p>
                     <p>Children cannot liue to desire baptisme, if their parents desire it for them, why may not the desire of others be theirs, as well as (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Austins</hi> opinion) the faith of others beleeuing, and the mouth of others confessing? In these cases therefore of any soules but our owne, it is safe to suspend,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176944:146"/> and dangerous to passe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secret things to God: Hee that made all soules, knowes what to doe with them, neither will make vs of counsaile: But if we define either way, the errors of charity are in offensiue. wee must honour good meanes and vse them, and in their necessarie want depend vpon him, who can worke, beyond, without, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst meanes.</p>

VVhat mad man would purchase this crackling of thornes (such is the wordlings ioy) with eternal shrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; tormēt? he that is the dore and the way, hath taught vs, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:176944:152"/> through many afflictions wee must enter into heauen. There is but one passage, and that a strait one: If with much pressure wee can get through, and leaue but our superfluous rags as torne from vs in the crowd; we are happy. Hee that made heauen, hath on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thus framed it; wide when we are entred, and glorious nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and hard in the entrance: that after our paine, our glory might be sweeter. And if before hand you can climbe vp thither in your thoughts; looke about you, you shall see no more palmes, then crosses: you shall see none crown'd, but those that haue wrestled with crosses and sorows, to sweat, yea to blood; and haue ouercome. All runs here to the ouercommer, and ouercomming
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:176944:152"/> implies both fighting, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. Girde vp your loynes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and strengthen your weake knees; resolue to fight for heauen, to suffer in fighting, to persist in suffering; so persisting you shall ouercome, and ouercomming you shall bee crowned. Oh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward truely great, aboue desert, yea, aboue conceit. A crowne for a fewe groanes: An eternall crowne of life and glory, for a short and momentany suffering: How iust is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> account, that the afflictions of this present life are not worthy of the glory which shall be shewed vnto vs? O Lord let me smart that I may reigne; vphold thou me in smar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that thou mayest holde mee worthy of reigning. It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how vile I be, so I may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:176944:153"/> VVhat say you? would you not bee afflicted? VVhether had you rather mourne for a while, or for euer; One must bee chosen: the election is easie: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had you rather reioyce for one fit or alwayes? You would doe both. Pardon me; it is a fond couetousnes, and idle singularity to affect it. What? That you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may fare better then all Gods Saints? That God should strew Carpets for your nice feet onely, to walke into your heauen, and make that way smooth for you, which all Patriarks, Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists, Confessors, Christ himselfe, haue found rugged and bloody? Away with this selfe loue; and come downe you am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Sonne of <hi>Zebedee:</hi> and ere you thinke of sitting neare the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:176944:153"/> throne, bee content to bee called vnto the Cup. Now is your tryall; Let your Sauiour see how much of his bitter potion you can pledge; then shall you see how much of his glory he can afford you. Be content to drinke of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and gall, and you shall drinke new wine with him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

Beholde, whiles your hand was happily busie in the defence of our King, the heads
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:176944:155"/> and hands of traitors were busie in the massacring of your owne. God doth no memorable, and publick act, which he would not haue talked of read, construed of all the world. How much more of neighbours, whom scarce a sea seuereth from each other? how much yet more of brethren, whom neither land, nor sea, can seuer? Your dangers, and feares, and griefes haue beene ours: All the salt water that runs betwixt vs cannot wash off our interest in all your common causes: The deadly blow of that miscreant (whose name is iustly sentenced to forgetfulnesse) pierced euen our sides. VVho hath not bled within himselfe, to thinke that he, which had so victoriously out-liued the swordes of enemies, should fall
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:176944:155"/> by the knife of a villaine? and that he should die in the peaceable streets, whom no fields could kil? that all those honorable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py triumphs should end in so base a violence? But oh our idlenesse, and impietie, if we see not a diuine had from aboue, striking with this hand of disloyalty. Sparrows fall not to the ground without him, much lesse Kings; One dyes by a tyle-sheard, another by the splinters of a Launce, one by Lice, another by a Fly, one by poyson, another by a knife; VVhat are all these but the executioners of that great God, which hath saide, Ye are Gods, but ye shall die like men? Perhaps God saw (that wee may guesse modestly at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of his acts) you reposed too much in this arme of flesh; or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:176944:156"/> Perhaps he saw this scourge would haue beene too early, to those ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whose sin, though great, yet was not full: or perhaps hee saw, that if that great spirit had beene deliberately yeelded in his bed, you shold not haue slept in yours: O perhaps the auncient conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence at those streames of bloud; from your too common doels, was now called to reckning; or, it may be; that weake reuolt from the truth. He whose the rod was, knows why he strooke: yet may it not passe without a note, that he fell by that religion, to which he fell. How many ages might that great monarch haue liued (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the ripe head of your more then mellow <hi>Cotton</hi> could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine) ere his least finger should haue bled, by the hand of an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenot?
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:176944:156"/> All religions may haue some monsters; but blessed be the God of heauen, ours shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yeeld that good Iesuite, either a <hi>Mariana</hi> to teach treason, or a <hi>Rauillas</hi> to act it. But what is that we heare? It is no maruell: That holy Society is a fit Gardian for the hearts of kings: I dare say, none more loues to see them none takes more care to purchase them. How happy were that Chappell (think they) if it were full of such shrines? I hope all Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue long, and well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (so great is the courtesie of these good Fathers) that they shall neuer (by their willes) neede bee troubled with the charge of their owne heartes. An heart of a KING in a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites hand, is as proper, as a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:176944:157"/> wafer in a Priests. Iustly was it written of old, vnder the picture of <hi>Ignatius Loyola, Cauete vobis Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes;</hi> Be wise O ye Princes, and learne to be the keepers of your owne hearts. Yea rather, O thou keeper of Israel, that neither slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest nor sleepest, keepe thou the hearts of al Christian Kings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aliue or dead, from the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of this traiterous generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whose very religion is wholy rebellion, and whose merits bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Doubtlesse, that murderer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to haue stabbed thousands with that blow, and to haue let out the life of religion, at the side of her collapsed Patron: God did at once laugh and frowne at his proiect; and suffred him to liue to see himselfe, no lesse a foole then a villaine. Oh the infinite
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:176944:157"/> goodnesse of the wise, and holy gouernor of the world; who could haue looked for such a calme in the middest of a tempest? who wold haue thought that violence could beget peace? Who durst haue conceived that King <hi>Henry</hi> should die alone? and that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion should loose nothing but his person? This is the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. You haue now parallel'd vs: Out of both our feares hath God fetched security: oh that out of our security, we could as easily fetch feare: not so much of euill, as of the Author of good; and yet trust him in our feare, and in both magnifie him. Yea, you haue by this act gained some conuerts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the hope of the agents: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I without many ioyfull

Wee should giue you example, if our peace were as plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifull of goodnesse as of pleasure.

I craue not your pardon, but your acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is no presumption to giue good counsell; and presents of loue feare not to bee ill taken of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176944:159"/> strangers. My pen and your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance are both giuen vs for one end, to doe good: These are our talents, how happy are we if wee can improue them well suffer me to doe you good with the one that with the other, you may doe good to many, and most to your selfe. You cannot but know, that your full hand, and worthy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses haue possessed the world with much expectation: what speake I of the world? whose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and reasonable claymes yet, cannot bee contemned with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor disappointed without dishonour. The God of heauen, which hath lent you this aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and giuen you these graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts of charity, of piety, looks long for the issue of both: &amp; wil easily complaine either of too
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:176944:159"/> little, or too late. Your wealth and your will are both good, but the first is onely made good by the second for if your hand were ful, and your heart empty, we who now applaud you, should iustly pitty you, you might haue riches, not goods, not blessings: your bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>then should be greater, then your estate; and you should be richer in sorrowes, then in mettalls. For (if wee looke to no other world) what gaine is it to be the keeper of the best earth? That which is the common cofer of all the rich mines, we doe but tread vpon; and account it vile, because it doth but holde, and hide those trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. Whereas the skilfull meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list that findeth, and refineth those precious veines, for publick vse, is rewarded, is honoured.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:176944:160"/> The very basest Element yeeldes golde; the sauage Indian gets it, the seruile prentise workes it, the very Midianitish Camell may weare it, the miserable worldling admires it, the couetous Iew swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it, the vnthrifty Ruffian spends it: what are al these the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it? Onely good vse giues praise to earthly possessions. Here in therfore you owe more to God, that he hath giuen you an heart to doe good a will to bee as rich in good workes, as great in riches. To be a friend to this Mammon, is to be an enemie to God: but to make friends with it, is roiall, and Christian. His enemies may be wealthie, none but his friends can either be good, or doe good: <hi>Da &amp; accipe,</hi> saith the wise man. The Christian which must imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:176944:160"/> the hie patterne of his creator, knows his best riches to be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; God that hath all, giues all; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues nothing. And for himselfe; he well considers, that God hath not made him an owner, but a seruant: and of seruants a seruant, not of his goods but of the giuer; not a treasurer, but a Steward: whose praise is more to lay out well, then to haue receiued much. The greatest gaine therfore that he affects, is an euen reckning, a cleare discharge: which since it is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by disposing, not by keeping, he counts reseruation losse, and iust expence his trade, and ioy; he knowes, that Well done faithfull seruant, is a thousand times more sweet a note, then Soule take thine ease; for that is the voyce of the master recompencing, this of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176944:161"/> the carnall heart presuming: and what follows to the one, but his masters ioy? what to the other, but the losse of his soule? Blessed bee that God which hath giuen you an heart to fore thinke this, and in this dry, and dead age, a will to honour him with his own: and to credit his Gospell, with your beneficence; Lo we are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayded with barrennesse: your name hath beene publikly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to these challenges, as in whom it shall be seene, that the truth hath friends that can giue. I neither distrust, nor perswade you, whose resolutions are happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed on purposes of good: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue mee leaue to hasten your pace a little, and to excite your Christian forwardnesse, to begin speedily, what you haue long and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:176944:161"/> constantly vowed. You would not but doe good; why not now? I speake boldly, the more speede, the more comfort: Neither the times are in our disposing, nor our selues: if God had set vs a day, and made our wealth inseparable, there were no danger in delaying; now our vncertainty either must quicken vs, or may deceiue vs. How many haue meant wel, and done nothing, and lost their crowne with lingring? whose destinies haue preuented their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and haue made their good motions the wards of their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not without miserable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: to whō, that they wold haue done good, is not so great a praise, as it is a dishonor that they might haue done it: their wracks are our warnings, we are equally mortal,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176944:162"/> equally fickle. Why haue you this respite of liuing, but to preuent the imperious necessity of death? it is a woful and remedilesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that the end of our dayes hath ouer-runne the beginning of our good workes. Early benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hath no danger, many ioies: for the conscience of good done, the prayers and blessings of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, the gratulations of the Saints, are as so many perpetuall comforters, which can make our life pleasant, and our death happy our euill dayes good, and our good better. All these are lost with delay, few and cold are the prayers for him that may giue: &amp; in lieu, our good purposes forestowed, are become our tormenters vpon our dead bed. Little difference is betwixt good differred, and euill
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176944:162"/> done: Good was meant, who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, will our conscience say? there was time enough, meanes enough, neede enough, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? Did feare of enuy, distrust of want? Alas what bugs are these to fright men from heauen? As if the enuy of keeping, were lesse then of bestowing: As if God were not as good a debtor, as a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: he that giues to the poore lendes to God, saith wise <hi>Salomon;</hi> If hee freely giue vs what wee may lend, and grace to giue; will he no much more pay vs what wee haue lent; and giue vs because wee haue giuen? That is his bounty, this his iustice Oh happy is that man that may be a creditor to his maker. Heauen and earth, shall be empty before he shall want a royall pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If wee dare not trust God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176944:163"/> whiles we liue, how dare we trust men when we are dead? Men that are still deceitfull, and light vpon the ballance, light of truth, heauy of selfe-loue. How many execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue proued the executioners of honest wills? how many haue our eies seen, that after most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full choise of trustie guardians, haue had their children and goods so disposed, as if the parents soule could returne to see it, I doubt whether it could be happy? How rare is that man that prefers not himselfe to his dead friend? profit to truth? that will take no vantage of the impossibility of account? What euer therefore men either shew, or promise, happy is that man that may bee his owne audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, superuisor, executor. As you loue God and your selfe, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:176944:163"/> of being happie too soone. I am not worthy to giue so bolde aduice, let the wise sonne of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> speake for me: Do good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou die, and according to thine ability stretch out thine hands, and giue: Defraud not thy selfe of thy good day; and let not the portion of thy good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires ouerpasse thee: Shalt thou not leaue thy trauels to another, and thy labours to them that will deuide thine heritage? Or let a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then he, <hi>Salomon:</hi> Say not, to morrow I will giue, if thou now haue it: for thou knowest not what a day will bring forth. It hath beene an old rule of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he giues twise that giues quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas slow benefites argue vnchearefulnesse, and lose their worth. Who lingers his receits is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176944:164"/> condemned as vnthriftie: he that knoweth both, saith, it is better to giue, then to receiue. If we be of the same spirit, why are we hasty in the worse, and slacke in the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Suffer your selfe therfore good Sir, for Gods sake, for the Gospels sake, for the Churches sake, for your soules sake, to bee stirred vp by those poore lines, to a resolute and speedy performing of your worthy intentions: and take this as a louing inuitation sent from heauen, by an vnworthie messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. You canot deliberate long of fit obiects for your beneficence, except it be more for multitude, then want: the streets, yea the world is full; How doth <hi>Lazarus</hi> lie at euery dore? how many Sons of the Prophets in their meanely-prouided Colledges may say, not,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:176944:164"/>
                        <hi>Mors in olla,</hi> but <hi>Fanies?</hi> how many Churches may iustly pleade, that which our Sauiour bad his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, The Lord hath need?

But now I find my selfe too bold and too busie, in thus looking toward particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: God shall direct you, and if you follow him, shall crowne you: howsoeuer, if good be done, and that be times: he hath what hee desired, and your soule shall haue more then you can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. The successe of my weake yet hearty counsell, shall make me as

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:176944:168"/> wearinesse: what would you say of him that finds better game in his studie, then you in the fielde; and would account your disport his punishment? such there are, though you doubt and wonder. Neuer think to detract from your businesse, but adde to your will. It is the policie of our great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, to driue vs with these feares, from that hee fore-sees would grow profitable: like as some in-hospitall Sauages make fearefull delusions by sorcery, vpon the shore, to fright strangers from landing. Where you find therfore motions of resistance, awaken your courage the more, &amp; know there is some good that appeares not; vaine indeauors find no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Al crosses implie a secret commoditie: resolue then to will
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:176944:168"/> because you begin not to will: and either oppose your selfe, as Satan opposes you, or else you doe nothing. We pay no price to God for any good thing, but labour; if we higgle in that, we are worthy to lose our bargaine. It is an inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable gaine, that we may make in this trafique: for God is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, as well as iust, and when he sees true indeauour, doth not only sell, but giue: whereas idlenes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gets nor saues, nothing is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more fruitlesse of good, or more fruitfull of euill; for we doe ill whiles wee doe nothing, and lose, whiles we gaine not. The sluggard is senselesse, and so much more desperate, because hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not complaine: but (though hee feele it not) nothing is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then time, or that shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:176944:169"/> a reckning more strict and fearefull: yea this is the measure of all our actions, which if it were not abused, our accounts could not be but euen with God: so God esteemes it (what euer our pride be) that he plagues the losse of a short time, with a reuenge beyond all times. Houres haue wings, and euery moment flies vp to the author of time, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries newes of our vsage: All our prayers cannot intreate one of them either to returne, or slacken his pace: the mispense of euery minute is a new record against vs in heauen. Sure, if we thought thus, wee would dismisse them with better reports, and not suffer them either to goe away empty, or laden with dangerous intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; how happy is it that euery
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:176944:169"/> houre should conuey vp, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the message, but the fruits of good, and stay with the Ancient of daies, to speake for vs before his glorious throne? know this and I shall take no care for your pains, nor you, for pastime. None of our profitable labours shall be transient, but euen when wee haue forgotten them, shall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vs into ioy wee thinke wee haue left them behind vs, but they are forwarder then our souls, and expect vs where wee would be. And if there were no crowne for these toiles, yet without future respects there is a tediousnesse in doing nothing. To man especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, motion is natural: there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde, nor eie, nor ioint which mooueth not: And as company makes way short,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:176944:170"/> houres neuer goe away so merrily, as in the fellowship of worke. How did that industrious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then draw out water by night, and knowledge by day, &amp; thoght both short, euer labouring onely that he might labour? Certainely if idlenesse were enacted by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, there would not want some, which would pay their mulct, that they might worke and those spirits are likest to heauen, which moues alwaies, and the freest from those corruptions, which are incident to nature. The running streame cleanseth it selfe, whereas standing ponds breede weedes, and mud. These medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must hearten vs to that we must do: whiles we are cheareful, our labours shall striue whether to yeeld vs more comfort, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more profit.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:176944:172"/> continually: yet not I hope, euer to fast and pray. Marke how the Apostle addes (that you may giue you selues to fasting and praier;) It is solemne exercise, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle here intends, such, as is ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with fasting, and externall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; wherin al earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts must be forborne. But what if a man list to taske himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and wil be alwaies pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deuote: may hee then neuer abstaine? No: (Let them meete together againe) saith the Apostle, not as a toleratiō, but as a charge? But what if they both can liue safe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly thus seuered? This is more then they can vndertake: there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, saith our Apostle, in this absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence (lest Satan tempt you for your incontinencie) what can be more plaine. Neither may the maried refraine this conuersation
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:176944:172"/> without cōsent: neither may they with consent, refraine it for euer. What can you now vrge vs with, but the examples, and sentences of some Ancients? Let this stand eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for the true and necessary sense of the Apostle, and what is this, but to lay men in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with God? I see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse how much some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers admired virginitie; so farre, that there wāted not some, which both detested mariage as vicious, and would force a single life vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on marriage, as commendable: whose authoritie should moue me, if I saw not some of them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to others, and others no lesse to Saint <hi>Paule</hi> himselfe.

                        </note> Hence is that of <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> that the wife is both the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and the Mistresse of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a seruant to yeeld her body, a Mistresse to haue power of his: who also in the same place deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it forbidden, fraude, for the husband, or wife to containe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone according to that of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrast Let either both containe, or neither. <hi>Hierome</hi> contrarily,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:176944:173"/> defines thus: But if one of the two (saith he) considering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of chastity, will containe, he ought not to assent to the other which containes not, &amp;c. because lust ought rather to come to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, then continencie decline to lust, concluding that a brother, or sister is not subiect in such a case; and that God hath not called vs to vncleannesse, but to holines. A strange glosse to fall from the pen of a Father: which yet I durst not say, if it were more boldnes for me to dissent from him, then for him to dissent from all others. He that censures Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to argue grosly to his Galatians, may as well taxe him of an vnfit directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Corinthians: It shall be no presumption to say, that in this point all his writings bewray

Antiquitie will afford you many examples of holy men voluntarily sequestred from their wiues: Precepts must bee our guides, and not patternes. You may tell me of <hi>Sozomens Ammon,</hi> that famous Monke, who hauing perswaded his bride the first day to continuance of virginitie, liued with her 18. yeares in a seuerall bed: and in a seuerall habitation, vpon the mountaine Nitria, 22. yeares, you may tell me of <hi>Ieromes Malchus, Austens Ecdicia,</hi> and ten thousand others: I care not for their number, and suspect their example: Doe but reconcile their

                     <p>The Apostle saies, Refraine not but with consent for a time: your words, and their practise saith, Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fraine with consent for euer: hee saith (meete together againe) you say, neuer more: hee saith (meere lest you bee tempted) you say, meete not though you bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176944:175"/> all matrimonical acts, &amp; thoghts: not for that they are sinfull, but vnseasonable. As marriage must be alwaies vsed chastly, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately: so sometimes it must be forgotten. How many are drunke with their owne vines, and surfet of their owne fruits? either immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, or immoderation in man or wife, is adulterous. If yet I shall further yeeld, that they may conditionally agree, to refrain frō each other, so long till they bee perplexed with temptations, on either part: I shall goe as farre as the reach of my warrant, at least perhaps beyond it: since the Apostle chargeth, Meete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine lest you bee tempted; not, meete when you are tempted. But to say, absolutely, and for euer renounce (by consent) the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176944:182"/> if you meete with some tough clods, that will not easily yeeld to the share, lay on more strength rather; seeke not remedie in your feet by flight, but in your hands, by a constant indeauor. Away with this weake timorousnesse, and wrongful humilitie: Be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and couragious in this great worke of God; the end shall be glorious your selfe happy, and many in you.</p>

                     <head>¶ A particular account how our dayes are, or should be spent, both common and holy.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very day is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle life, and our whole life is but a day repeated: whence it is, that old <hi>Iacob</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers his life by dayes, and <hi>Moses</hi> desires to be taught
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:176944:184"/> this point of holy Arithmeticke, to number not his yeares, but his dayes: Those therefore that dare loose a day, are daungerously prodigall; those that dare mis-spend it, desperate. We can best teach others by our selues: Let mee tell your Lordship, how I would passe my dayes, whether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Sacred; that you (or whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer others, ouer-hearing me) may eyther approoue my thriftinesse, or correct my errors: To whom is the account of my houres either more due, or more knowne? All dayes are his, who gaue time a beginning, and continuance; yet some he hath made ours, not to command, but to vse. Jn none may we forget him, in some we must forget all, besides him. First therefore, I desire to awake at those houres, not when I will, but when I must: pleasure is not a fit rule for rest,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:176944:184"/> but health: neyther doe I consult so much with the Sunne, as mine owne necessity, whither of body, or, in that, of the minde. If this vassall could wel serue mee waking, it should neuer sleepe: but now, it must bee pleased, that it may bee seruiceable. Now, when sleepe is rather driuen away, then leaues mee; I would euer awake with God; my first thoughts are for him, who hath made the night for rest, and the day for trauell: and as he giues, so blesses both. Jf my heart be earely seasoned with his presence, it will sauour of him all day after. While my body is dressing, not with an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate curiosity, nor yet with rude neglect; my minde addresses it selfe to her insuing Task; bethinking what is to be done, and in what order; and marshalling (as it may) my houres with my work: That done after some
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176944:185"/> whiles Meditation, I walke vp to my Maisters &amp; companions, my bookes; and sitting down amongst them, with the best contentment, I dare not reach forth my hand to salute any of them, till I haue first looked vp to Heauen, and craued fauour of him to whom all my Studies are duly referred: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whome, I can neither profit, nor labour. After this, out of no ouer-great variety, J call forth those, which may best fit my occasions; wherein, I am not too scrupulous of age: Somtimes I put my selfe to Schoole, to one of those Auncients, whom the Church hath honoured with the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whose Volumes, I confesse, not to open, without a secret reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their holinesse, and grauitie: Sometimes, to those later Doctours, which want nothing but age to make them classicall: Alwayes to GODS
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:176944:185"/> Booke. That day is lost, wherof some houres are not improued in those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Monuments: Others I turn ouer out of choyse, these out of duty. Ere I can haue sat vnto wearinesse, my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hauing now ouercome all house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-distractions, inuites mee to our common deuotions; not without some short preparation. These hartily performed, send mee vp, with a more strong and chearefull appetite to my former worke, which I find made ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to me by intermission, and variety: Now therefore, can I deceiue the houres with change of pleasures, that is, of labours. One while mine eyes are busied, another while my hand, &amp; sometimes my minde takes the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from them both: Wherein, I would imitate the skilfullest Cookes, which make the best dishes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mixtures: one houre is spent in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176944:186"/> Textuall Diuinity, another in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy; histories relieue them both. Now, when the minde is weary of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers labors, it begins to vndertake hir owne; sometimes it meditates, and windes vp for future vse; sometimes it layes foorth her conceits into present discourse; sometimes for it selfe, ofter, for others. Neither know I whether it workes or playes in these thoughts: I am sure no sport hath more pleasure, no work more vse: Only the decay of a weake body, makes me thinke these delights insensibly laborious. Thus could I all day, (as Ringers vse) make my selfe Musicke with chaunges, and complain sooner of the day for short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then of the businesse for toyle; were it not that this faint moniter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts me stil in the midst of my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie pleasures, and inforces me both to respite &amp; repast: I must yeeld to both; while
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:176944:186"/> my bodie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd mind are ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in these vnequal couples, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must follow the weaker. Before my meales therefore, and after, I let my selfe loose from all thoughts, and now, would forget that I euer study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: A full minde takes away the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies appetite, no lesse then a full body makes a dull and vnweildy minde: Company, discourse, recreations, are now seasonable and welcome; These prepare me for a diet, not gluttonous, but medicinall; The Palate may not be pleased, but the stomack; nor that for it owne sake: Neither woulde I thinke any of these comforts woorth respect in themselues, but in their vse, in their end; so farre, as they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to better things. If I see any dish to tempt my Palate, J feare a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in that Apple, and would please my selfe in a wilfull denyall: I rise ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:176944:187"/> of more, not desirous: not now immediately from my Trencher, to my Booke; but after some intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moderate speede is a sure helpe to all proceedings, where those things which are prosecuted with violence of indeuour, or desire, either succeed not, or continue not.</p>
                     <p>After my latter meale, my thoughts are slight, onely my memorie may be charged with her Taske, of recalling what was committed to her custodie in the day, and my heart is busie in examining mine hands and mouth, &amp; all other sences of that dayes behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. And now the Euening is come, no Trades-man doth more carefully take in his Wares, cleare his Shoppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord, and shut his Windowes, then J would shut vp my thoughts, &amp; clear my minde. That Student shall liue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably, which like a Camell lies down
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:176944:187"/> vnder his burden. All this done, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together my familie, we end the day with God. Thus do wee rather driue away the time before vs, then follow it. I graunt, neither is my pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise worthy to be exemplarie, neither are our callings proportionable. The lyues of a Nobleman, of a Courtier, of a Scholler, of a Cittizen, of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman, differ no lesse then their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: yet must all conspire in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest labour. Sweat is the destiny of all trades, whether of the browes, or of the minde. God neuer allowed anie man to do nothing. How miserable is the condition of those men, which spend the time as if it were giuen thē, and not lent: as if houres were waste Creatures, and such as should neuer be accounted for; as if GOD would take this for a good Bil of reckoning; <hi>Item,</hi> spent vpon my pleasures, fortie
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:176944:188"/> yeares. These men shal once finde, that no bloud can priuiledge idlenes; and that nothing is more precious to God, then, that which they desire to cast away, <hi>Tyme.</hi> Such are my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon daies: but Gods day cals for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other respect. The same Sunne arises on this day, and enlightens it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Sun of righteousnesse arose once vpon it, &amp; gaue a new life vnto the world in it, &amp; drew the strength of Gods moral precept vnto it therfore iustly do we sing with the <hi>psalmist; This is the day which the Lorde hath made.</hi> Now, I forget the world, and in a sort, my selfe; and deale with my wonted thoughts, as great men vse, who, at sometimes of their priuacie, forbid the accesse of all suters. Prayer, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reading, hearing, preaching, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, good conference, are the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of this day; which I dare not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:176944:188"/> on anie worke, or pleasure, but heauenly. J hate superstition on the one side, and loosenesse on the other; but I finde it harde to offend in too much deuotion, easie in profanenesse. The whole Week is sanctified by this day, and according to my care of this, is my blessing on the rest. I show your Lordship, what I would do, and what I ought: I commit my desires to the imitation of the weake, my actions to the censures of the Wise and Holye; my weakenesses to the pardon and redresse of my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God.</p>

                     <p>As if the Worlde were not euery where; as if wee could hide our selues from the Diuel; as if solitarinesse were priuiledged from Temptations; as if wee did not more violently affect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained delights; as if these <hi>Hieromes</hi> did not finde <hi>Rome</hi> in their hart, when they had nothing but rockes &amp; trees in their eye. Hence these places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrednesse, founded at first vppon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity mixt with deuotion, haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176944:190"/> infamously vnclean; Cels of lust, not of piety. This course is preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; If I were worthy to teach you a better way, learne to bee an <hi>Hermit</hi> at home: Begin with your owne heart, estraunge and weane it from the loue, not from the vse of the world. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity hath taught vs nothing, if wee haue not learned this distinction; It is a great weakenesse not to see, but wee must be inamored: <hi>Elisha,</hi> saw the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret state of the <hi>Syrian</hi> court, yet as an enemy: The blessed Angelles see our earthly affayres, but as strangers: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his body was in the Court of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> amongest the delicate <hi>Egiptians,</hi> his heart was suffering with the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Israelites.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:176944:191"/> vs Christians, but wee are bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? We see the Sun daily, &amp; warme vs at his beames, yet make not an Idol of it; doth any man hide his face, least he should adore it? All our safetie or danger therefore, is from within. In vaine is the body an <hi>Anachoret,</hi> if the heart be a <hi>Ruffian:</hi> And if that bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred in affections, the body is but a Cipher: Lo then the eyes will looke carelessely and strangely in what they see, and the tongue will sometimes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to that was not asked. We eate and recreate, because wee must, not because we would: and when wee are pleased, wee are suspicious: Lawfull delights, we neyther refuse, nor dote vpon, and all contentments goe and come like strangers. That all this may be done, take vp your hart with better thoughts; be sure it will not be empty, if Heauen haue fore-stalled all the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:176944:191"/> roomes, the Worlde is disappointed, and eyther dares not offer, or is repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Fixe your selfe vpon the glory of that eternity, which abides you after this short pilgrimage. You cannot but contemne what you find in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of what you expect. Leaue not til you attaine to this, that you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to liue, because ye cannot as yet be dissolued: Be but one halfe vppon earth, let your better part conuerse aboue whence it is, and enioy that whereto it was ordained. Thinke how little the World can doe for you and what it doth, how deceitfully: what stings there are with this Hony, vvhat farewell succeeds this Welcome.</p>
                     <p>When this <hi>Iael</hi> brings you Milk in the one hand, know shee hath a nayle in the other. Aske your heart what it is the better, what the merrier, for all those pleasures wherewith it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:176944:192"/> you: let your own trial teach you contempt; Thinke how sincere, how glorious those ioyes are, which abide you elsevvhere, and a thousand times more certaine (though future) then the present.</p>
                     <p>And let not these thoughts be fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but fixed: Jn vaine do we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, if we resolue not: when your hart is once thus setled, it shall commaund all things to aduantage.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is none, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or more troblesom guest, then Sin. Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, both in the solicitation of it, and in the remorse. Before the act, it wearies vs with a wicked impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:176944:194"/> after the act it torments vs with feares, and the painful gnawings of an accusing Conscience: Neyther is it more irkesome to men, then odious to God; who indeed neuer hated any thing but it; and for it any thing. How happy were we, if we could be rid of it? This must be our desire, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be our hope; so long as wee carry this bodie of sinne and death about vs: yet (which is our comfort) it shall not carry vs, though wee carry it: It will dwell with vs, but with no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund; yea, with no peace: Wee grudge to giue it house-roome, but wee hate to giue it seruice. This our <hi>Hagar</hi> wil abide many strokes, ere she be turned out of doores; she shall go at last, and the seede of promise shall inherit alone. There is no vnquyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse good, but this: and in this case, quietnesse cannot stand with safetie:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:176944:194"/> neither did euer warre more truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get peace, then in this strife of the soule.</p>
                     <p>Resistance is the way to victory, and that, to an eternall peace and happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It is a blessed care then, how to resist sinne, how to auoyd it: and such as I am glad to teach and learne. As there are two grounds of all sin, so of the auoydance of Sinne; Loue, and Feare: These if they be placed amisse, cause vs to offend: if aright, are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of euill: The Loue must be of God; Feare, of Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>As he loues much, to whom much is forgiuen, so hee that loues much, will not dare to dooe that which may neede forgiuenesse. The heart that hath felt the sweetnesse of Gods mercies, will not abide the bitter rellish of sinne: This is both a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger motiue then Fear, and more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:176944:195"/> None but a good heart is capable of this grace: which who so hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, thus powerfully repelles ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                     <p>Haue I found my God so gracious to me that hee hath denyed mee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, eyther in earth or heauen: and shal not J so much as deny my owne will for his sake? Hath my deare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour bought my soul at such a price, and shall he not haue it? Was hee cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for my sinnes, and shall I by my sinnes crucifie him againe? Am J his in so many bonds, and shall J serue the Diuel? O God! is this the fruit of thy beneficence to me, that J should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dishonor thee? Was thy blood so little worth, that I should treade it vnder my feete? Dooth this become him that shall be once glorious vvith thee? Hast thou prepared heauen for me, and do I thus prepare my selfe for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:176944:195"/> heauen? Shall I thus recompence thy loue, in dooing that which thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test? Satan hath no Dart (I speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently) that can pierce this Shielde: Christians are indeed to oft surprized, ere they can holde it out: there is no small pollicy in the suddainenesse of temptation: but if they haue once set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it before their brest, they are safe, and their enemy hopelesse. Vnder this head therefore, there is sure remedie against sinne, by looking vpwardes, backwards, into our selues, forwards. Vpwards, at the glorious Maiesty, and infinite goodnesse of that God whom our sinne would offend, and in whose face we sin: whose mercies, &amp; whose holynesse is such, that if there were no hel, we would not offend. Backwards, at the manifold fauours, whereby we are obliged to obedience. Into our selues, at that honourable vocation,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:176944:196"/> wherewith he hath graced vs, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profession we haue made of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and grace, that solemne vowe &amp; Couenant, whereby we haue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our profession; the gracious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of that spirit in vs, which is grieued by our sinnes, yea quenched. Forwards, at the ioy which will follow vpon our forbearance, that peace of conscience, that happy expectation of glory, compared with the momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and vnpleasing delight of a present sinne; All these, out of Loue; Fear is a retentiue, as necessary, not so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous. Jt is better to be wonne, then to be frighted from sinne: to be allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then drawne. Both are little inough in our pronesse to euil: Euil, is the onely obiect of feare. Heerein therefore, wee must terrifie our stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnnesse, with both euils; Of losse, and of sence: that if it be possible, the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:176944:196"/> honor of the euent may counteruaile the pleasure of the tentation: Of losse, remembering that now we are about to loose a God; to cast away all the comforts &amp; hopes of another world; to rob our selues of all those sweete mercies we inioyed; to thrust his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit out of doores (which cannot abide to dwell within the noysom stench of sinne) to shut the doores of heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our selues.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:176944:199"/> of our censures, especially concerning Religion: wherein we are wont to be eyther carelesse, or too peremptory: How farre, and wherein Popery ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the foundation, is worth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry: I neede not stay vpon wordes. By foundation, we mean the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry groundes of Christian faith. This foundation Papistry defaces, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new; by casting downe the old. In these cases, addition destroyes: he that obtrudes a new worde, no lesse ouerthrowes the Scripture, then hee that denyes the olde, yea this, very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion denies: he that sets vp a newe Christ, reiects Christ: Two foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot stand at once: The Arke and <hi>Dagon.</hi> Now Papistry layes a double new foundation: The one, a new rule of faith, that is, a new word: The other, a new Author, or guide of Faith, that is, a newe head besides
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:176944:199"/> Christ: God neuer layde other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then in the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: vpon their Diuine writing, he meant to build his Church; which hee therefore inspired, that they might be like (himselfe) perfect and eternall: Popery buildes vppon an vn-written word, the voyce of old (but doubtful) Traditions. The voyce of the present Church, that is, as they interpret it, theyrs; with no lesse confidence and presumption of certainety, then any thing euer Written by the finger of God; If this be not a new foundation, the old was none. God neuer taught this holy Spouse to knowe any other husband, thē Christ; to acknowledge any other head; to followe any other Shepheard, to obey any other King: he alone may be inioyed without iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, submitted to without danger, without errour beleeued, serued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:176944:200"/> scruple: Popery offers to impose on Gods Church a King, shepheard, head, husband, besides her owne: A man; a man of sin. He must know all things, can erre in nothing: direct, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, animate, cōmand, both in earth and Purgatory, expounde Scriptures, cannonize Saints, forgiue Sins: create new Articles of Faith; and in all these, is absolute and infallible as his Maker; who sees not, that if to attribute these things to the son of God, bee to make him the foundation of the Church; Then to ascribe them to another, is to contradict him that sayde, <hi>Other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation can no man lay, then that which is layde, which is Iesus Christ.</hi> To lay a new foundation, doth necessarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the old yet see this further actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done in particulars: wherein yet this distinction may cleare the way: The foundation is ouerthrowne two
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:176944:200"/> wayes; either in flat tearmes, when a mayne principle of faith is absolutely denyed as the deity and consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality of the Sonne by <hi>Arrius,</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of persons by <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Serue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the resurrection of the bodye by <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> the last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Mockers; Or secondly, by consequent; when anie opinion is maintained, which by iust sequell ouer turneth the trueth of that principle, which the defendant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to holde; yet so, as hee will not graunt the necessity of that deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so the Ancient <hi>Minoei,</hi> of whom <hi>Ierom</hi> speaketh, while they vrged Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, by consequent according to <hi>Paules</hi> rule, reiected Christ: so the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> while they defended a full perfection of our righteousnes in our selues, ouerthrew Christes iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and in effect sayde, <hi>I beleeue in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:176944:201"/> Christ, and in my selfe:</hi> so some <hi>Vbiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> while they hold the possibility of the conuersion, and saluation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, ouerthrow the Doctrine of Gods eternall decree, and immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Popery comes in this latter ranks and may iustly be tearmed heresie, by direct consequent: Though not in their graunt, yet in necessarie proofe and inference. Thus it ouerthrowes the truth of Christs humanity, while it holds his whole humaine body local<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumscribed in heauen, &amp; at once (the same instant) wholy present in ten thousand places on earth, without cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription: That whole Christ is in the formes of bread, with all his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions, euery part hauing his own place and figure: and yet so, as that he is wholly in euery part of the breade. Our iustification, while it ascribes it to our owne workes: The Al-sufficiency
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:176944:201"/> of Christs owne Sacrifice, whiles they reiterate it daily by the handes of a Priest. Of his satisfaction, while they holde a payment of our vtmost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, in a deuised Purgatory. Of his mediation, while they implore others to ayde them, not only by their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, but their merites; suing not onely for their Prayes, but their gifts: The value of the Scriptures, whiles they hold them insufficient, obscure, in points essentiall to saluation, &amp; bind them to an vncertaine dependance vpon the Church. Besides hundreds of this kind, there are heresies in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contrary to those fundamentall practises which God requires of his: As prohibitions of Scriptures to the Laity: Prescriptions of deuotion in vnknowne tongues: Tying the effect of Sacraments and Prayers to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worke: Adoration of Angels,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:176944:202"/> Saints, Bread, Reliques, Crosses, Jma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: All which, are as so many reall vnderminings of the sacred foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is no lesse actiue, then vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. By this, the simplest may see what we must holde of Papists; neyther as no Heretiques, nor yet so palpable as the worst: If any man aske for theyr conuiction. In the simpler sort, I grant this excuse fayre and tollerable! Poore soules, they cannot bee any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise informed, much lesse perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Whiles in trueth of heart, they hold the maine principles which they know, doubtlesse, the mercie of God may passe ouer their ignorant weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in what they cannot know. For the other, I feare not to say, that many of their errours are wilfull. The light of truth hath shined out of heauen to them, and they loue darkenesse more then light. Jn this state of the Church
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:176944:202"/> hee shall speake and hope idly, that shall call for a publique and vniuersall euiction: How can that be, when they pretend to bee Iudges in their owne cause? Vnlesse they wil not be aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to themselues, or iudges of vs, this course is but impossible: As the Diuell, so Antichrist, will not yeelde: both shall bee subdued; neyther will treat of peace: what remains, but that the Lorde shall consume that wicked man (which is now clearely reuealed) with the breath of his mouth, &amp; abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish him with the brightnes of his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Euen so, <hi>Lord Iesus come quickly.</hi> This briefly is my conceit of Popery, which I willingly refer to your clear &amp; deepe iudgement, being not more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to teach the ignoraunt what I knowe, then to learne of you what I should teach, &amp; know not. The Lord direct all our thoughts to his glory, &amp; the behoofe of his Church.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:176944:208"/> man hath them. But these priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and charges are giuen to the Church: True; to be executed by hir Gouernours, the faculty of speech is giuen to the whole man, but the vse of it to the proper Instrument. Man speaketh; but by his toong; if a voice should be heard from his hand, eare, foote, it were vnnaturall. Now, if the tongue speak not when it ought, shall we be so foolish as to blame the hand? But you say; If the tongue speake not, or speak ill, the whole man smarteth; the man sinneth: I graunt it, but you shall set the naturall body on too hard a racke, if you straine it in all thinges, to the likenesse of the spirituall, or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. The mēbers of that being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the same soule, haue charge of each other, and therefore either stand or fall together: It is not so in these. If then notwithstanding vnpunnished
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:176944:208"/> sinnes wee may ioyne with the true Church: Whether is ours such? You doubt, and your solicitors deny: sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if wee haue many enormities, yet none worse then rash and cruel iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; let them make this a colour to depart from themselues: there is no lesse woe to them that cal good, euil: To iudge one man is bold and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: Iudge then, what it is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a whole church: God knowes, as much without cause, as without shame. Vaine men may libel against the spouse of Christ: her husband ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diuorc't her: No, his loue is still aboue their hatred, his blessinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their censures: Do but ask them, were we euer the true church of God? If they deny it, Who then were so? Had God neuer Church vpon earth, since the Apostles time, till <hi>Barrow</hi> &amp; <hi>Greenwood</hi> arose? And euen then
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:176944:209"/> scarce a number? nay, when or where was euer any man in the worlde (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Schooles perhaps of <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> or <hi>Nouatus</hi>) that taught their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and now still hath hee none, but in a blind lane at <hi>Amsterdam?</hi> Can you thinke this probable? If they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, when ceased we? Are not the pointes controuerted still the same? The same Gouernment, the same do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Their minds are changed, not our estate: Who hath admonished, euinced, eccommunicated vs; and when? All these must be done; Will it not be a shame to say, that <hi>Francis Iohnson,</hi> as he tooke power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Brother, and Father; so had power to excōmunicate his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Church? How base and idle are these conceits? Are we then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes condemned in our selues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ouerthrowe wee the foundation?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:176944:209"/> What other God, Sauiour, Scriptures, Iustification, Sacraments, Heauen, do they teach beside vs? Can al the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of seperation, yea can al the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Christendome, set forth a more exquisite and woorthy confession of Faith, then is contained in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Church of England? Who can hold these, and be hereticall? Or, from which of these are we reuolted? But to make this good, they haue taught you to say, that euery trueth in Scripture is fundamentall; so fruitfull is errour of absurdities; Whereof stil one breedes another more deformed then it selfe. That <hi>Trophimus</hi> was left at <hi>Miletum</hi> sicke, that <hi>Pauls</hi> Cloake was left at <hi>Troas,</hi> that <hi>Gaius Paules</hi> hoast, saluted the <hi>Romaines,</hi> that <hi>Naball</hi> was drunke; or that <hi>Thamar</hi> baked Cakes, and a thousand of this nature are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall: how large is the separatists
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:176944:210"/> Creed, that hath all these Articles? If they say al Scripture is of the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, of the same authority: so say we, but not of the same vse: is it as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a Christian to knowe that <hi>Peter</hi> hosted with one <hi>Simon</hi> a tanner in <hi>Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> as that Iesus Christ the son of God was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> What a mōster is this of an opiniō, that al tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eths are equal? that this spiritual house should be all foundation, no wals, no roofe? Can no man be saued but hee that knowes euery thing in scripture? Then both they and we are excluded: heauē wold not haue so many, as then Parlor at <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> Can any man be saued that knowes nothing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? It is far frō them to bee so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable to affirm it: you see thē that both al truths must not of necessity be known, &amp; some must: &amp; these we iustly call fundamental: which who so hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, al his hay &amp; stubble (through the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:176944:210"/> mercy of God) condemn him not: stil he hath right to the church on erth, &amp; hope in heauē: but whither euery truth be fundamētal, or necessary: discipline (you say) is so: indeed necessary to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of a church, no more: it may be true without it, not perfect. Christ cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his spouse to an army with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: as order is to an army, so is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to the Church: if the troups be not well marshalled in their seuerall ranks, &amp; moue not forward, acording to the discipline of warre, it is an army stil: cōfusion may hinder their succes, it cannot bereaue thē of their name: it is, as beautiful proportiō to the body, an hedge to a vineyard, a wal to a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an hem to a garment, feeling to an house. It may be a body, vineyard, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, garment, house, without them: it cannot be wel and perfect: yet which of our aduersaries vvill say wee haue
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:176944:211"/> no Discipline? Some they graunt, but not the right: as if they sayde? Your Citty hath a Bricke-wall indeede, but it should haue one of hewen stone; your Vineyard is hedged, but it shold be paled &amp; ditched: while they cauill at what wee want, wee thanke God for what wee haue; and so much we haue, in spight of all detraction, as makes vs both a true Church, and a worthy one.</p>
                     <p>But the mayn quarrel is against but Ministery, and forme of worship let these be examined; this is the Circle of their censure. No Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Ministery: and no Ministery, therefore no Church: vnnatural sons, that spit in the face of those spirituall Fathers that begot them, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bore them.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:176944:211"/> Are we all vnlearned, vnsuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? Not a man that knowes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the word aright? As <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> is it so that there is not one wise man amongest vs? No man vvill affirm it: some of them haue censured our excesse in some knowledge; none, our defect in all: What then? Haue we not a true desire to do faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to God and his Church? No zeal for Gods glory? Who hath beene in our harts to see this?

Yea, we appeale to that only Iudge of harts, whether he hath not giuen vs a sincere longing for the good of his <hi>Syon:</hi> he shall make the thoughts of al hearts manifest: and then shall euerie man haue praise of God: if then wee haue both ability and will to do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good: our inward calling (which is the mayne poynt) is good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:176944:212"/> for the outward, what want wee? Are we not first (after good triall) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented &amp; approued by the learned, in our Colledges: examined by our church-gouernors, ordaind by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hāds of the eldership, alowed by the congregations, we are set ouer: do we not labor in word &amp; doctrine? do we not carefully administer the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Lord Iesus? haue we not by our publick means won many soules to God? what shuld we haue &amp; do more? Al this, &amp; yet no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? we passe very little to be iudged of thē, or of mans day: but our ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (you say) are Antichristian: surely our censures are vnchristian: tho we shold grant it: some of vs were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by hereticks: is the sacrament an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, and must it bee redoubled? How much lesse ordination, which is but an outward admission to preach
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:176944:212"/> the gospel? God forbid that we shold thus condemne the innocent: more hands were laid vpon vs, then one: &amp; of them, for the principall, except but their perpetual honor, &amp; som few im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall rites, let an enemy say what they differ, from Super-intendents? &amp; can their double honor make them no elders? Jf they haue any personal sales, why is their calling scourged? Looke into our Sauiours times: what corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were in the very Priesthood? It was now made annual, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fixed &amp; singular Christ saw these abuses, &amp; was silent heere was much dislike, and no clamour; we for lesse, exclaim &amp; seperate: euen personal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences are fetcht into the condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of lawfull courses.

How like are wee to children, in the training vp of our children?

Now at last, with what measure of Learning their owne wil would vouchsafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, they are too earely sent to the Common Nurseries of Knowledge; There (vnlesse they fal vnder carefull tuition) they study in iest, and play in earnest.

Men esteem of opinions, because their owne; &amp; will haue truth serue, not gouerne; What they haue vnder-taken, must be true: Victory is sought for, not satisfaction; Victory of the Authour, not of the cause: Hee is a rare man that knowes to yeeld, as wel to argue: what shold we do then, but bestow our selues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that which too many neglect, publicke peace; first, in Prayers that we may preuaile, then in teares that we preuaile not?

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176944:227"/> our selues; For outward euils, which come from the infliction of others, make vs cleaue faster to our helpers, and cause vs to seeke and finde ease in the very commisseration of those that loue vs: whereas those griefes which arise from the iust displeasure of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, will not abide so much, as the memory of others affection; or if it do, makes it so much the greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasiue, as our case is more vncapeable of their comfort. Such is yours. You haue made the mention of our names tedious to your selfe, and yours to vs. This is the beginning of your payne, that you had frends: If you may now smart soundly from vs, for your good, it must be the onely ioy you must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and the finall dutie wee owe to you. It is both vaine and comfortlesse to heare what might haue beene; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would J send you backe to what
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176944:227"/> is past, but purposely to increase your sorrow; who haue caused al our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to stand in your teares. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our former Counsailes had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, neyther had your hands shed innocent bloude, nor Iustice yours. Now, to your great sinne, you haue done the one, and the other must be done to your paine, and we your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers, with sorrow and shame liue to be witnesses of both. Your sin is gone before, the reuenge of Iustice wil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: Seeing you are guilty, let GOD be iust; Other sinnes speake, this cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and will neuer be silent, till it bee answered with it selfe. For your life; the case is hopeles; feed not your selfe with vaine presumptions, but settle your selfe to expiate anothers bloude vvith your owne. Would God your desert had beene such, that we might vvith any comfort haue desired you
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176944:228"/> might liue. But now, alas, your fact is so heynous; that your life can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee craued without in-iustice, nor bee protracted without inwarde torment. And if our priuate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shoulde make vs deafe to the shouts of bloud, and partiality should teach vs to forget all care of publicke right, yet resolue, there is no place for hope. Since then you could not liue guiltlesse, there remaines no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that you labour to dye pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; and since your bodye cannot bee saued aliue, to endeuour that your soule may bee saued in death. Wherein, howe happye shall it bee for you, if you shall yet giue eare to this my last aduice; too late indeede for your recompence to the Worlde, not too late for your selfe. You haue deserued death, and expect it; Take heede least you so fasten your eyes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:176944:228"/> vppon the first death of the body, that you should not look beyond it, to the second, which alone is worthy of trē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, worthy of teares.</p>
                     <p>For this, though terrible to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet is common to vs, with you. You must dye: What doe wee else? And what differs our end from yours, but in hast and violence? And vvho knowes whether in that? It may bee a sickenesse as sharpe, as suddaine, shal fetch vs hence: It may bee the same death, or a worse, for a better cause: Or if not so, There is much more miserie in lingering: Hee dies easily, that dyes soone: But the other, is the vtmost vengeaunce that GOD hath reserued for his enemies: This is a matter of long feare, and short payne. A few panges let the soule out of prison; but the Torment of that other is euerlasting; after tenne
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176944:229"/> thousand yeares scorching in that flame, the payne is neuer the neerer to his ending. No time giues it hope of abating; yea, time hath nothing to do with this eternity. You that shall feele the paine of one minutes dying, thinke what paine it is to be dying for euer and euer. This, although it bee attended with a sharpe paine, yet is such as some strong spirits haue indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without shew of yeildance. I haue herd of an Irish Traitor, that when he lay pining vppon the wheele with his bones broke, asked his friend if hee changed his countenance at all: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lesse for the paine, then the shew of feare. Few men haue dyed of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines, then others haue sustained and liue. But that other ouer-whelms both body and soule, and leaues no roome for any comfort in the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of mitigation. Heere, men are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:176944:229"/> executioners, or diseases; there fiends. Those diuels that were ready to tempt the gracelesse vnto sinne, are as ready to follow the damned with tortures. Whatsoeuer becom of your carcasse, saue your soule from these flames: and so mannage this short time you haue to liue, that you may die but once. This is not your first sinne; yea, God hath now punnished your former sins with this: A fearefull punishment in it selfe, if it deserued no more: your cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (which now beginnes to tell trueth) cannot but assure you, that there is no sinne more worthy of hell, then murder; yea, more proper to it. Turne ouer those holy leaues (which you haue too much neglected, &amp; now smart for neglecting) you shall finde Murderers among those that are shut out from the presence of God: you shall finde the Prince of that darknes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:176944:230"/> in the highest stile of his mischief, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Man-slayer. Alas! how fearefull a case is this, that you haue heerein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled him, for whome <hi>Topheth</hi> was prepared of old, and imitating him in his action, haue endangered your self to partake of his tormēts. Oh, that you coulde but see what you haue done, what you haue deserued; That your heart could bleed enough within you, for the bloud your handes haue shed: That as you haue followed Satan our common enemy in sinning, so you could defye him in repenting: That your teares could disapoint his hopes of your damnation. What an happy vnhappinesse shall this he to your sad friendes, that your better part yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth? That frō an ignominious place, your soule is receyued to glory? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can effect this but your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that can do it. Feare not to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:176944:230"/> looke into that horrour, which should attend your sinne, and bee now as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere to your selfe, as you haue beene cruell to another. Thinke not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate your offence with the vain Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of man-hood; what praise is this, that you were a valiaunt Murderer? Strike your owne breast (as <hi>Moses</hi> did his Rocke) and bring down Riuers of tears to wash away your bloud-shed. Do not so much feare your iudgment, as abhorre your sinne, yea, your selfe for it: And with strong cries lift vppe your guilty hands to that God whom you offended, and say: <hi>Deliuer mee from blood-guiltines O Lord.</hi> Let me tell you, as without repentance there is no hope, so with it, ther is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. True penitence is strong, &amp; can grapple with the greatest sin, yea with all the powers of hell. What if your hands be red with blood? Behold, the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:176944:231"/> blood of your Sauiour, shall wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way yours: If you can bath your selfe in that; your Scarlet soule shall be as white as Snow. This course alone shal make your Crosse the way to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice of God. This plaister can heale all the sores of the soul, if neuer so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate: Onely, take heede that your heart bee deepe enough pierced, ere you lay it on; else vnder a seeming skinne of dissimulation, your soule shall fester to death. Yet ioy vs vvith your true sorrowe, whome you haue grieued with your offence; &amp; at once comfort your friends, and saue your soule.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:176944:240"/> but ouerlay it not: In al your businesses look throgh the world, at God; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is your leuell, let him bee your scope: Euery day take a view of your last, and thinke either it is this, or may be: Offer not your selfe either to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or labour; let them both seeke you: Care you onely to be woorthy, and you cannot hide you from God; so frame your self to the time &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, that you may neyther serue it, nor sullenly neglect it; and yeelde so far, as you may neither betray good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor countenance euil. Let your words bee few, and digested; It is a shame for the tongue to cry the heart mercie, much more to cast it selfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vncertaine pardon of others eares. There are but two things which a Christian is charged to buy, and not to sell, <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> both, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that we must purchase them at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:176944:240"/> anie rate. So vse your friends, as those which should be perpetuall, may bee chaungeable; while you are within your selfe, there is no daunger: but thoughts once vttered must stande to hazard. Do not hear from your selfe, what you would be loath to hear from others. In al good thinges giue your eye and eare the ful scope, for they let into the minde; restraine the tongue, for it is a spender: fewe men haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them of silence: In all serious matters take counsel of daies, &amp; nights and friends; &amp; let leasure ripen your purposes: neither hope to gain ought by suddennesse: The first thoughtes may be confident, the second are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. Serue honestie euer, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apparant wages: she wil pay sure, if slow: As in apparell, so in actions, know not what is good, but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you: how manie warrantable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:176944:241"/> acts haue mishapen the Authors. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse not your owne ill, aggrauate not others: and if you loue peace, auoide Censures, comparisons, contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: out of good men chuse acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, of acquaintance, friends, of friends, familiars: after probation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, &amp; after admittance change them not: Age commendeth friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Do not alwayes your best; it is neither wise, nor safe for a man euer to stand vpon the top of his strength. If you would be aboue the expectation of others, bee euer below your selfe. Expende after your purse, not after your minde; take not where you may deny, except vpon Conscience of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, or hope to requite. Eyther fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent suites, or complaints, are weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to any friende: Rather smother your griefes and wantes as you may, then be either querullous, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:176944:241"/> Let not your face belye your heart, nor alwaies tell tales out of it; he is fit to liue amongst frends or eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that can be ingenuously close: Giue freely, sell thriftily: Change sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome your place, neuer your state: either amend inconueniences, or swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; rather then you should run from your selfe to auoide them.</p>
                     <p>In al your reckonings for the world, cast vp some crosses that appeare not; either those will come, or may: Let your suspicions bee charitable; your trust fearfull; your censures sure. Giue way to the anger of the great: The Thunder and Cannon will abide no fence. As in throngs we are affraid of losse; so while the world comes vpon you, look wel to your soule; There is more danger in good, then in euil: I fear the number of these my rules; for Precepts are wont (as nayles) to driue
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:176944:242"/> out one another: but these, I intended to scatter amongest many: and I was loath that anie guest should complain of a niggardly hand; Daintie Dishes are woont to be sparingly serued out; homely ones, supply in their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what they want in their worth.</p>
